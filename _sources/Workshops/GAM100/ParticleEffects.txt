Create a New Project

:ref:`CreateNewProject`

A **particle effect** is a way of using a large number of small sprites or
meshes to simulate something chaotic, abstract, or "fuzzy," such as smoke, fire,
explosions, rain, magical effects, and so on.

Each individual object created by a particle effect is called a particle.
Normally, the word *particle* is used to mean something very small, but the
particles spawned by a particle effect may be any size. Each particle has its
own individual properties, like Translation, Velocity, etc, and they may have
different values from one particle to the next.

In the Zero Engine, Particle Systems are composed of three main components and
several extra optional components for added behavior.

The required components for any particle system are

* a **Particle System** component
* a **Particle Emitter** component
* a **Particle Animator** component

Create a Particle Effect
------------------------

* :ref:`Command<CommandsGAM100>`: ``CreateTransform`` or
  :menuselection:`Create --> Create Transform`
* In the Properties Window

  * Set Name to: ``SparkleParticles``
  * Click on *Add Component...* and then enter: ``Particle``
  
  |AddComponentParticle|



The particle-related components that we can add will appear in the pop-up list:

|ParticleComponentsNoSystem|



Particle System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* In the Properties Window
  
  * :ref:`Add a SpriteParticleSystem component <AddComponentGAM100>`
    
    |SpriteParticleSystemProperties|
    
    *The SpriteParticleSystem component*

The ``SpriteParticleSystem`` component falls under the **Particle System**
category. A Particle System component controls properties like

* the type of particle used (Sprites, in this case)
  
  * the image resource used for the system's Sprites
* the coordinate system the particles should live in
* how the particles should be graphically displayed or **rendered**



Let's see what other components we can add to our particle effect.

* In the Properties Window
  
  * Click on *Add Component...* and then enter: ``Particle``
  
  |AddComponentParticle|

Some of the choices that were grayed out before are now available because we
have a ``SpriteParticleSystem`` component already. Here are the available
particle effect-related components:

|ParticleComponentsNoEmitter|

Let's start out with the ``SphericalParticleEmitter``.



Particle Emitter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* In the Properties Window
  
  * :ref:`Add a SphericalParticleEmitter component <AddComponentGAM100>`
    
    |SphericalParticleEmitterProperties|
    
    *The SphericalParticleEmitter component*



The ``SphericalParticleEmitter`` component falls under the **Particle Emitter**
category. A Particle Emitter component controls the creation of particles using
specified characteristics, like

* the spawn location
  
  * in the case of a ``SphericalParticleEmitter``, it's a sphere around the
    emitter's position
* the number of particles to be spawned
* the size of the particles
* the particles' starting velocities
* the life span of the particles

Let's check the list of available components once more.

* In the Properties Window
  
  * Click on *Add Component...* and then enter: ``Particle``
  
  |AddComponentParticle|



We see, again, a list of additional particle-related components that we can add
to this effect. Our focus turns now to the various *animators*.

|ParticleComponentsNoAnimator|

We'll go with the ``LinearParticleAnimator`` for now.

Particle Animator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* In the Properties Window
  
  * :ref:`Add a LinearParticleAnimator component <AddComponentGAM100>`
    
    |LinearParticleAnimatorProperties|
    
    *The LinearParticleAnimator component*

The ``LinearParticleAnimator`` component falls under the **Particle Animator**
category. A Particle Animator component modifies the system's particles that
already exist over the duration of their lifetimes. The
``LinearParticleAnimator`` does things like changing the particles' sizes and
applying forces to them.

* :ref:`Select the SparkleParticles object <SelectObjectGAM100>`



Particles are now being created in the Level Window:

|NoBookBegin|
|ActiveParticlePreviewGif|
|NoBookEnd|

|ActiveParticlePreviewPng|


Notice that the particles are colorless squares, and are being created with
random initial velocities. This is because the ``SpriteParticleSystem``
component's **Texture** property is set to the default texture, and the
``SphericalParticleEmitter`` component's **StartVelocity** property is
``[0, 0, 0]`` and its **RandomVelocity** property is
``[2, 2, 2]``.

* :ref:`Save the project<SavingProjectGAM100>`

Let's change the sprite the particles are using.



Import Particle Sprites
-----------------------

We'll be using a handful of different sprites for our particles in this lesson.

* :ref:`Download the following files from the Void: <UsingTheVoidGAM100>`
  
  * ``Cloud.png``
  * ``FastSpark.png``
  * ``Fire.png``
  * ``Twinkle.png``
* Select the SparkleParticles object
* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under ``SpriteParticleSystem``
    
    * Set Texture to: ``Twinkle``
    * Set RenderMode to: ``Additive``
    
    |SetRenderModeAndTexture|


    
Now let's get rid of the velocity and make the particles spawn in a sphere shape
using the SphericalParticleEmitter.

  * Make the ``SphericalParticleEmitter`` match these settings:
    
    * Set SpinVariance to: ``0``
    * Set RandomSpin to: ``false``
    * Set RandomVelocity to: ``[0, 0, 0]``
    * Set EmitterSize to: ``[5, 5, 5]``
    
    |SparkleParticlesEmitterSettings|

The particle effect is now emitting particles in the shape of a sphere with a
radius of ``5`` (hence the 5's in the **EmitterSize** property). Let's make it
more obvious that it's a sphere.

    * Set EmitRate to: ``500``



The **EmitRate** property controls how many particles are spawned per second, so
particles should now be emitted more rapidly to fill the sphere before they die:

|SparkleParticlesNoGrowth|

  * Under LinearParticleAnimator
    
    * Set Growth to: ``-1``
    
The **Growth** property indicates how much each particle should change its size
per second. Using a negative value for Growth causes the particles to shrink.

Let's move on from the SparkleParticles effect for now.

  * Under SphericalParticleEmitter
    
    * Set Active to: ``false``



Particle Effect Properties
--------------------------

Here is a brief overview of the function of a few of the many properties of the
constituent components of a particle effect.

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Particle System (in this case, ``SpriteParticleSystem``)                         |
+====================+=============================================================+
| **RenderMode**     | Determines the way that the sprites blend with one another  |
|                    | where they overlap. **Generally,** ``Additive`` **should be |
| |RenderModeB1|     | used with sprites that have a black background.**           |
|                    |                                                             |
| |RenderModeB2|     |                                                             |
|                    |                                                             |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **SystemSize**     | Defines the dimensions of an invisible box centered at the  |
|                    | system's Transform. If no part of this box can be "seen" by |
|                    | any active camera, then none of the system's particles are  |
|                    | drawn.                                                      |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Particle Emitter (in this case, ``SphericalParticleEmitter``)                    |
+====================+=============================================================+
| **EmitCount**      | How many particles the emitter will spawn. If this property |
|                    | is set to ``0``, then the emitter will spawn an **infinite  |
|                    | number of particles**.                                      |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **EmitRate**       | How many of the emitter's particles will be spawned per     |
|                    | second. To effectively spawn them all at once, set this     |
| |EmitRateB1|       | property to its maximum value of ``50000``.                 |
|                    |                                                             |
| |EmitRateB2|       |                                                             |
|                    |                                                             |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Spin**           | The rotational speed in degrees per second of each particle |
|                    | spawned.                                                    |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| -**Variance**      | Each of the various **Variance** properties defines a range |
|                    | of random values that will additionally be applied to its   |
| |SizeVarianceB1|   | corresponding invariant property. For instance, an emitter  |
|                    | with a **Spin** of ``90`` and a **SpinVariance** of ``30``  |
| |SizeVarianceB2|   | will spawn particles with rotational speeds ranging from    |
|                    | ``60`` to ``120`` degrees per second.                       |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **RandomSpin**     | Whether or not the particles should be spawned with a       |
|                    | random **initial rotation**.                                |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **RandomVelocity** | The random variance of the particles' starting velocities.  |
|                    |                                                             |
| |RandomVelocityB1| |                                                             |
|                    |                                                             |
| |RandomVelocityB2| |                                                             |
|                    |                                                             |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **EmitterSize**    | The dimensions of the volume within which the emitter may   |
|                    | spawn particles.                                            |
| |EmitterSizeB1|    |                                                             |
|                    | * In the case of a ``SphericalParticleEmitter``, this       |
| |EmitterSizeB2|    |   determines the X, Y, and Z radii of the spheroid that is  |
|                    |   the emitter volume.                                       |
|                    |                                                             |
|                    |   * With a ``SphericalParticleEmitter``, if one dimension   |
|                    |     of the **EmitterSize** is ``0``, the emitter will be    |
|                    |     **ring-shaped**.                                        |
|                    | * In any case, an **EmitterSize** of ``[0, 0, 0]`` will     |
|                    |   result in an emitter whose particles all spawn at a       |
|                    |   single point, the emitter's Transform.                    |

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Force**          | Determines a constant acceleration vector applied to each   |
|                    | particle over its lifetime.                                 |

+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Growth**         | Indicates how much each particle should change its size per |
|                    | second. Using a **negative value** will cause the particle  |
|                    | to **shrink** instead of grow.                              |
+--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+



Make Another Particle Effect
----------------------------

We made the last particle effect from scratch for learning purposes. Now we'll
make another one, this time using the **CreateParticleSystem** command to make a
basic particle effect that we can then modify to our liking.

* :ref:`Command<CommandsGAM100>`: ``CreateParticleSystem`` or
  :menuselection:`Create --> Create Particle System`
* :ref:`Select the BasicParticleEffect object we just created <SelectObjectGAM100>`

  |BasicParticleEffectProperties|

  *The starter particle effect comes with some basic components*



  * Use the TranslateGizmo to move the BasicParticleEffect object up and down
    on the world Y axis (the green arrow):
    
    |WorldSpaceB1| |WorldSpaceB2|

Observe how the particles do not move when you move their system. The position
they are spawned in depends on the position of the emitter that spawned them,
but after that, they're on their own. *This is because they are using the World
coordinate system.* We can make the particles follow their emitter by changing
the **SystemSpace** property on the ``SpriteParticleSystem`` component.

* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under ``SpriteParticleSystem``
    
    * Set SystemSpace to: ``LocalSpace``



This will confine the system's particles to the local coordinates of the
BasicParticleEffect cog that spawned them.

* Use the TranslateGizmo to move the BasicParticleEffect object again:

    |LocalSpaceB1| |LocalSpaceB2|

Now the particles remain locked in position relative to the BasicParticleEffect
object, so that when it moves, they all move with it.

* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under SpriteParticleSystem
    
    * Set Texture to: ``Square``
    * Set RenderMode to: ``Additive``
  * Under SphericalParticleEmitter
    
    * Set Size to: ``2``
    * Set SizeVariance to: ``1.5``
    * Set SpinVariance to: ``0``
    * Set RandomSpin to: ``false``
    * Set RandomVelocity to: ``[4, 4, 4]``



Multiple Particle Animators
---------------------------

Unlike with the Emitter and System category of particle effect components,
multiple Particle Animator components *can* live on the same particle effect at
the same time. Different animators affect their particles in different ways, and
we can combine them to get cool effects.

Notice how the BasicParticleEffect object already has two of them: the
``LinearParticleAnimator`` component, which we've seen before, and also the
``ParticleColorAnimator`` component.



ParticleColorAnimator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  * Under the **ParticleColorAnimator** component
    
    |ParticleColorAnimatorProperties|

The **ParticleColorAnimator** component will make each particle's color change
over its lifetime. Each particle will be created with a starting color of
``Color0``, and then the color will *change over time*, or **interpolate**, to
``Color1``, and then to ``Color2``, and so on. Keep in mind that the particles'
colors will be multiplied by the **Tint** property of the
``SpriteParticleSystem`` component to achieve the final color that is displayed,
so they may not appear exactly as chosen.

    * Set Color0 to: ``[R: 255, G:   0, B:   0, A: 1.00]``, ``#FF0000``
    * Set Color1 to: ``[R: 255, G: 212, B:   0, A: 1.00]``, ``#FFD400``
    * Set Color2 to: ``[R:   0, G: 192, B:  96, A: 1.00]``, ``#00C060``
    * Set Color3 to: ``[R:  64, G: 128, B: 255, A: 1.00]``, ``#4080FF``
    * Set Color4 to: ``[R: 255, G:   0, B:  64, A: 1.00]``, ``#FF0040``
      
      |ColorAnimatorWithColors|

Notice how the BasicParticleEffect object's particles are now changing from one
color to the next over each particle's lifetime.




|FabulousParticlesPng|


* In the Properties Window
  
  * Set Name to: ``FabulousParticles``
* :ref:`Save the project <SavingProjectGAM100>`

Now let's add another animator.



ParticleAttractor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **ParticleAttractor** component is a Particle Animator that causes its
particles to be pulled toward their cog's center.

* In the Properties Window
  
  * Click on *Add Component...* and then enter: ``Particle``
  * :ref:`Add a ParticleAttractor component <AddComponentGAM100>`

The ParticleAttractor's **Strength** property defines how strongly the particles
are pulled toward the center. The **MinDistance** and **MaxDistance** properties
define the bounds within which this pull is applied.

When a particle is within the **MinDistance** from its center, it is pulled with
100% of the ParticleAttractor's Strength. A particle that moves past the
MinDistance is pulled less and less as it goes. When a particle is beyond the
**MaxDistance** from its center, it is not pulled at all. Refer to the following
diagram:

|ParticleAttractorDiagram|

Here, the black spot in the middle is centered at the location of a particle
effect. The radius of the black spot is the attractor's **MinDistance**. Within
that spot, a particle is pulled with full **Strength** toward the center. The
white region outside of the largest circle represents the area where the
attractor has no influence on its particles. The radius of the largest circle is
the attractor's **MaxDistance**. As a particle moves through the gray areas, it
is pulled more or less, depending on whether it is moving toward or away from
the center.

  * Under SphericalParticleEmitter
    
    * Set RandomVelocity to: ``[10, 10, 10]``



With high-velocity particles, we'll need a high-strength attractor.

  * Under ParticleAttractor
    
    * Set Strength to: ``20``


Now the attractor is strong enough to noticeably pull its particles back toward
its center.


  * Under SpriteParticleSystem
    
    * Set SystemSpace to: ``WorldSpace``
    
* Use the TranslateGizmo to move the FabulousParticles object around

Notice how, when the system's SystemSpace property is set to ``WorldSpace``, it
is easy to "lose" some of the effect's particles if you move it quickly enough.

* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under SpriteParticleSystem
    
    * Set SystemSpace back to: ``LocalSpace``
* Use the TranslateGizmo to move the FabulousParticles object around again

When the SystemSpace is set to ``LocalSpace``, nothing you can do through the
Transform alone can cause the particles to escape.

* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under Transform
    
    * Set Translation to: ``[0, 0, 0]``
* :ref:`Save the project <SavingProjectGAM100>`

Next, we'll learn how to build a fire.

* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under SphericalParticleEmitter
    
    * Set Active to: ``false``



Making Fire
-----------

Let's take what we've learned so far and apply it. We'll take what we know about
the real-world phenomenon we're trying to emulate and use it to make our effect
look great.

* :ref:`Command<CommandsGAM100>` : ``CreateParticleSystem`` or
  :menuselection:`Create --> Create Particle System`
* :ref:`Select the BasicParticleEffect object we just created <SelectObjectGAM100>`
* In the Properties Window
  
  * Set Name to: ``Fire``
  * Under SpriteParticleSystem

First of all, let's use a cool image for each wisp of flame.

    * Set Texture to: ``Fire``

This particular image has a black background that will not be visible if the
RenderMode is set to ``Additive``.

    * Set RenderMode to: ``Additive``

Next, we know that fire is orange.

    * Set Tint to: ``[R: 128, G: 102, B:  25, A: 1.00]``, ``#806619``

|FirePostSystem|



That's it for the system's properties. Let's move on to the emitter.

  * Under SphericalParticleEmitter

.. sidebar:: Additive Magic
  
  You may be curious about how it is that the flame has several colors within
  it, even though we've only set a single color for the system's Tint property,
  and we haven't touched the effect's ParticleColorAnimator component.
  
  |AdditiveFireColors|
  
  This is all thanks to the SpriteParticleSystem's **RenderMode** property being
  set to ``Additive``.
  
  When two additive sprites overlap, the color of the pixels you see is
  determined by adding the colors of the two sprites --- the ``R`` value is the
  sum of the two overlapping ``R`` values, the ``G`` value is the sum of the two
  overlapping ``G`` values, and so on. But this addition gets capped off --- a
  sprite's color can't have an ``R``, ``G``, or ``B`` value above 255.
  
  This means that, when enough additive particles are grouped together, their
  colors add up to white *as long as their R, G, and B values are greater than
  zero.*



Now, first off, it's kind of hard to really see what we're looking at, so let's
crank the EmitRate up pretty high.

    * Set EmitRate to: ``800``

This fire is exploding in all directions, but we want it to go mostly up.

    * Set StartVelocity to: ``[0, 4, 0]``

A convincing flame generally has something of a teardrop shape, so we want to
make the particles in our fire effect appear clustered at the base of the flame
and taper upward from there. By making the Y-part of the RandomVelocity match
the Y-part of the StartVelocity, we can ensure that the particles' upward speeds
will range from zero to twice the Y-part of the StartVelocity. This will cause
the bunching we want. Then, we can throw in a little bit of horizontal variance
too, just to make the fire look a bit more chaotic.

    * Set RandomVelocity to: ``[0.4, 4, 0.4]``

Let's increase the chaos of the effect further by setting the SizeVariance to
match the Size and the LifetimeVariance to match the Lifetime.

    * Set SizeVariance to: ``1``
    * Set LifetimeVariance to: ``1``

Let's put a little bit more of a twist on each particle by increasing the
SpinVariance.

    * Set SpinVariance to: ``180``

|FirePostEmitter|



Now we can really drive the effect home in the LinearParticleAnimator component.

  * Under LinearParticleAnimator

Flickers of flame shrink as they rise, so we should apply a negative Growth.

    * Set Growth to: ``-2``

But as these flickers get further away from the source of the heat, they should
also slow down a bit.

    * Set Dampening to: ``1``

Finally, we can make the fire dance by giving it plenty of RandomForce.

    * Set RandomForce to: ``[10, 10, 10]``

|FirePostAnimator|



One good particle effect deserves another.

  * Under Transform
    
    * Set Translation to: ``[-6, -6, 0]``
    
* **Duplicate** the object by pressing ``Ctrl + D``

* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under Transform
    
    * Set Translation to: ``[6, -6, 0]``

Let's turn on all of our effects and see how they all look together.

* :ref:`Multi-select the SparkleParticles, FabulousParticles, and both Fire
  objects<SelectObjectGAM100>`
* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under SphericalParticleEmitter
    
    * Set Active to: ``true``



* :ref:`Save the project <SavingProjectGAM100>` and :ref:`run the game <RunTheGame>`

Finally, we'll learn how to control the weather.

  * Under SphericalParticleEmitter
    
    * Set Active to: ``false``



Weather Effects
---------------

One common practical application of particle effects is simulation of weather.
Let's try a couple of weather effects now.

Make it Rain
~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far, the particle effects we've seen have all been tightly localized: our
Sparkle effect has an emitter radius of 5, and our Fabulous particles all spawn
in exactly the same point. But particles don't necessarily have to be in a tight
group like that. Particle effects can quite effectively simulate, say, rain,
regardless of the overall size of the area being rained on.

* :ref:`Command<Commands>` : ``CreateParticleSystem`` or
  :menuselection:`Create --> Create Particle System`
* :ref:`Select the BasicParticleEffect object we just created <SelectObject>`
* In the Properties Window
  
  * Set Name to: ``Rain``
  * :ref:`Remove the SphericalParticleEmitter component <RemoveComponent>`
  * :ref:`Remove the ParticleColorAnimator component <RemoveComponent>`
  * :ref:`Add a BoxParticleEmitter component <AddComponent>`
  * Under SpriteParticleSystem
    
    * Set Texture to: ``Circle``
    * Set RenderMode to: ``Additive``
    * Set Tint to: ``[R: 255, G: 255, B: 255, A: 0.4]``, ``#FFFFFF``
    * Set SystemSize to: ``[50, 50, 4]``
  * Under BoxParticleEmitter
    
    * Set EmitRate to: ``2000``
    * Set Size to: ``0.1``
    * Set SizeVariance to: ``0.1``
    * Set Lifetime to: ``0.6``
    * Set LifetimeVariance to: ``0``
    * Set StartVelocity to: ``[0, -100, 0]``
    * Set RandomVelocity to: ``[0, 0, 0]``
    * Set EmitterSize to: ``[100, 50, 0]``
  * Under Transform
    
    * Set Translation to: ``[0, 35, 0]``



  |RainBillboarded|

.. sidebar:: GeometryMode: Beam
  
  Setting the SpriteParticleSystem's **GeometryMode** property to ``Beam``
  causes the particles to orient themselves automatically to the direction
  they're moving in, and to stretch themselves in that direction as they go.
  
  * When using the ``Beam`` setting, you can alter the **VelocityScale**
    property to change how much of an effect each particle's speed has on its
    length.

It looks alright, but raindrops tend to look better when they're stretched a
bit. We can accomplish this by changing the particle system's **GeometryMode**
property to ``Beam``. (We also have a better sprite we can use for the
particles, so we'll make that switch too.)

  * Under SpriteParticleSystem
    
    * Set GeometryMode to: ``Beam``
    * Set VelocityScale to: ``0.5``
    * Set Texture to: ``FastSpark``



Observe how the raindrops are stretched in the direction they're moving. We can
even make it a bit windy by applying some horizontal velocity, and the drops
will still be stretched correctly:

  * Under BoxParticleEmitter
    
    * Set StartVelocity to: ``[10, -100, 0]``

We can make it even more blustery by adding some **RandomForce** to the effect:
  
  * Under LinearParticleAnimator
    
    * Set RandomForce to: ``[50, 50, 0]``
    
  |RainBeam|

* :ref:`Save the project <SavingProject>`
* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under BoxParticleEmitter
    
    * Set Active to: ``false``



Make it Snow
~~~~~~~~~~~~

For our snow effect, let's begin by duplicating our rain and modifying the copy.

* **Duplicate** the object by pressing ``Ctrl + D``
* In the Properties Window
  
  * Set Name to: ``Snow``
  * Under BoxParticleEmitter
    
    * Set Active to: ``true``
  * Under SpriteParticleSystem
    
    * Set Texture to: ``Cloud``
    * Set Tint to: ``[R: 255, G: 255, B: 255, A: 1.00]``, ``#FFFFFF``
    * Set GeometryMode to: ``Billboarded``
  * Under Transform
    
    * Set Translation to: ``[0, 15, 0]``
  * Under BoxParticleEmitter
    
    * Set EmitRate to: ``200``
    * Set Size to: ``0.2``
    * Set SizeVariance to: ``0.2``
    * Set Lifetime to: ``10``
    * Set StartVelocity to: ``[0, -5, 0]``
    * Set EmitterSize to: ``[100, 10, 0]``
  * Under LinearParticleAnimator
    
    * Set RandomForce to: ``[3, 3, 0]``



  |Snow|

* :ref:`Save the project <SavingProject>`
* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under BoxParticleEmitter
    
    * Set Active to: ``false``



Clouds
~~~~~~

Let's cap off our weather systems with a standard Redmond, Washington cloudy
sky.

* :ref:`Command<Commands>` : ``CreateParticleSystem`` or
  :menuselection:`Create --> Create Particle System`
* :ref:`Select the BasicParticleEffect object we just created <SelectObject>`
* In the Properties Window
  
  * Set Name to: ``Clouds``
  * :ref:`Remove the SphericalParticleEmitter component <RemoveComponent>`
  * :ref:`Add a BoxParticleEmitter component <AddComponent>`
  * Under SpriteParticleSystem
    
    * Set Texture to: ``Cloud``
    * Set Tint to: ``[R: 224, G: 224, B: 224, A: 1.00]``, ``#E0E0E0``
    * Set SortMode to: ``Sorted``
    * Set SystemSize to: ``[50, 50, 4]``
  * Under BoxParticleEmitter
    
    * Set Size to: ``8``
    * Set SizeVariance to: ``2``
    * Set Lifetime to: ``20``
    * Set LifetimeVariance to: ``10``
    * Set SpinVariance to: ``0``
    * Set StartVelocity to: ``[0.3, 0, 0]``
    * Set RandomVelocity to: ``[0.25, 0.05, 0.05]``
    * Set EmitterSize to: ``[50, 4, 0]``

* Under Transform

    * Set Translation to: ``[0, 10, 0]``
    


  |Clouds|

* :ref:`Save the project <SavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <RunTheGame>`

Take note of how it takes several seconds for the sky to populate itself
properly with clouds. We want the clouds to appear all at once, so we have to
fix this problem. That's where the SpriteParticleSystem component's
**WarmUpTime** property comes in: it "primes" the system by making it as if it
had been already been running when it is first created.

* :ref:`Stop the game <StopGame>`



Using a high value for WarmUpTime can be somewhat expensive, so it's good
practice to keep it as small as necessary to make its effect clear. In this
case, with the way that we've created our cloud system, a WarmUpTime of about
half the emitter's **Lifetime** should do the trick.

* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under SpriteParticleSystem
    
    * Set WarmUpTime to: ``10``
* :ref:`Save the project <SavingProject>`
* :ref:`Select the LevelSettings object <SelectObject>`
* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under CameraViewport
    
    * Set Scaling to: ``Letterbox``
* :ref:`Select the Rain object <SelectObject>`
* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under BoxParticleEmitter
    
    * Set Active to: ``true``

  together

Now we know the basics of particle effects and how to manipulate them through
Particle Systems, Particle Emitters, and Particle Animators.
