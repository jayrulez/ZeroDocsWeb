Level Setup
-----------

Create the Test Sprite

*   :ref:`Command<CommandsGAM100>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`

*   :ref:`Select the Sprite you created <SelectObjectGAM100>`

*   In the Properties Window

    *   Set name to: AreaTest
    
    *   Under Transform
    
        *   Set Scale to: ``[5, 1, 1]``

    *   Under Sprite

        *   Set SpriteSource to: ``SquareBordered``

Why Area?
---------

Notice that the edges of the sprite are all blurry. How can we fix that?

* In the Properties Window

    * :ref:`Add the Area Component <AddingComponentsGAM100>`
    
    * Under Transform
    
        *   Reset Scale to: [1, 1, 1]    
        
    * Under Area
    
        * Set Size to: [5, 1]
        
        
Here is what it will look like

|NineSliced|

First note that Area's Size unlike scale will not be inherited by children.
        
Now the edges are nice on our sprite. This is because the default Square sprite already has feature know as nine slice scaling enabled. 

Here is how it works.

Adding Your Own Nine Sliced Sprite
----------------------------------

* Download the ``Basic UI`` package from The Void.

* Import a Nine Slice ready sprite (any button sprite will do).

* Find the sprite in the library and edit it

* In Sprite Editor Window

    * Set the mode to nine slice

    * Change the Left, Right, Top, and Bottom to 5,5,5,5

    |NineSliceSettings|


    
* Select this sprite on your object

|NiceButton|



Tiling Mode
-----------

Sprites can also be tiled by the Area component

* Download the ``VD1_TilableBackground`` package from The Void.

* Import a tilable sprite to your project.

* Find the sprite in the library

* In Sprite Editor Window

    * Set the mode to Tiled

* :ref:`Command<CommandsGAM100>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`

* In the Properties Window

    * Set the sprite to tiled background

    * :ref:`Add the Area Component <AddingComponentsGAM100>`
        
    * Under Area
    
        * Set Size to: [200, 200]
