Level Setup
-----------

*   :ref:`CreateNewProject`

Here is our new empty level:

 |EmptyLevelWeb|



|EmptyLevelBook|


The level is not actually empty because there is a Camera object (notice the
|CameraIcon|
in the Level window) as well as other objects that come with a level by default:

|DefaultObjects|



Create a Game Object
--------------------

* Select Menu :menuselection:`Create --> Create Transform`
  
  |MICreateTransform|

Notice that the Transform object can be found in the Objects Window:

  |OWNewTransform|

* In the Objects Window

  * Click on the Transform object
* If the Properties Window is not visible, then enter the Command: ``Properties`` in the Search Window. 
  (Remember you can open the Search Window from any where in the engine using ``Ctrl+Shift+Space``.)

The properties of the Transform component attached to the object can be found in the Properties Window:

  |PWTransform|

* In the Properties Window

  * Click on the |UnderArrow| next to the Transform component
    

  
This displays the properties of the Transform component:

.. sidebar:: "Under"
 
 When accessing properties using the |UnderArrow| we use the term "Under". For instance:
 
 * In the Properties Window

   * Under the Transform Component
     
     * Set Scale To: [2, 2, 1]
      
 You would have to press the |UnderArrow| to see the Scale Property that is listed **under** the Transform component.

|PWTransformContents|

The Transform component provides the Translation (position), Rotation, and Scale of an object. 


An object has been created at the center of the level, but we can't see it yet. Let's add a visual component to our game object.

Adding a Component
------------------

* In the Properties Window

  * Click the |AddComponentButton| button 

This brings up the Add Component drop down:

|AddComponentDropDown|

* Start typing: “Sprite”



The Sprite component should appear in the drop down selection:

|SpriteComponentSearch|

* Click on Sprite to add a Sprite component

In the Properties Window, we can see that the Transform object now has a Sprite component:

|PWTransSprite|

You can also add components to a selected object by using the hotkey ``Ctrl+M``.

.. sidebar:: Camera Controls
    
    `Pan:` 
    
    * Middle Mouse Button + Drag
    * E + Left Mouse Button + Drag
    * E + Right Mouse Button + Drag
    * Arrow Keys
    * WASD
    
    `Zoom:` 
    
    * Scroll Wheel
    * Shift + Middle Mouse Button + Drag (up/down)
    
    with an object selected:
    
    * Double Tap F
    
    `Rotate (In Mode3D):`
    
    * Right Mouse Button + Drag
    * Q + Left Mouse Button + Drag
    * Q + Middle Mouse Button + Drag
    
     :ref:`Switching Mode2D/Mode3D <SwitchingMode2Dto3DGAM100>`



The Sprite component provides a 2D visual representation of the Transform object. In the Level Window, we can see the Transform object's Sprite:

|DefaultSprite|

The question mark is the visual representation of the Sprite object known as a **SpriteSource**. We won't go into much detail about what exactly is a SpriteSource and how they work just yet. Instead, we just need to know that the square with the question mark inside is the DefaultSprite.

Changing the Name of an Object
------------------------------

* In the Objects Window
  
  * Select the Transform object by clicking on it
  
  |OWSelectTransform|

* In the Properties Window

  * Set Name to: Square

     |PWSetNameSquareWeb|
     |PWSetNameSquareBook| 

  

  * Under Sprite

    * Set SpriteSource to: Square

    |PWSetSSToSquare|

Making a Copy of an Object
--------------------------

* :ref:`Select the Square object <SelectObjectGAM100>`
* Duplicate it:
 
  * Press ``Ctrl+C`` to copy it 
  * Press ``Ctrl+V`` to paste a new copy
    

Notice how there are 2 Square objects in the Objects Window,
but we only see one in the Level Editor.

* :ref:`Select a Square object <SelectObjectGAM100>`
* In the Properties Window

  * Set Name to: BlueSquare
  * Under Transform

    * Set Translation to: [5, 0, 0]
  * Under Sprite

    * Click on the |PWColorProperty| Color property



The following window should appear:

|ColorPickerRed|


    * Set Color to: [R:0, G:128, B:255, A:1.00]

      |ColorPickerBlue|

    * Click the OK button

The level should look like this:

|LWWhiteAndBlueSquare|



Running the Game
----------------

There are multiple ways to run the game in the editor.

1. Press ``F5`` key on the keyboard 
2. Press the |TBPlayButton| button 
3. :ref:`Command<CommandsGAM100>` : ``PlayGame`` or :menuselection:`Project --> Play Game`

* :ref:`Save the project <SavingProjectGAM100>` and :ref:`run the game <RunTheGameGAM100>`

Here is how the game should look:

 |GWWhiteAndBlueSquareWeb|


|GWWhiteAndBlueSquareBook|


* :ref:`Stop the Game <StopGameGAM100>`



Changing Visibility
-------------------

We are able to choose whether or not a sprite is visible when the level starts by setting the Sprite component's Visible property to True or False.


* :ref:`Select the Square object<SelectObjectGAM100>`

.. sidebar:: "Set ... to: True" "Set ... to: False"
    
    Many properties are simply flags that mark something as on or off, true or false. In the Zero Engine these types of properties are shown as checkboxes.

    Those checked are **True**, those unchecked are **False**.
    
    |Checkboxes|
    
    *Notice SelectChildren is set to: False and SelectRoot is set to: True*

* In the Properties Window

  * Under Sprite

    * Set Visible to: False

   |MakeInvisible|

* :ref:`Save the project <SavingProjectGAM100>` and :ref:`run the game <RunTheGameGAM100>`

The Square object is not visible, but keep in mind that it is indeed still there.

* :ref:`Stop the Game <StopGameGAM100>`
* :ref:`Select the Square object<SelectObjectGAM100>`
* In the Properties Window

  * Under Sprite

    * Set Visible to: True
        

        
Translate Tool
--------------

Another way to move objects around in the editor is by using the TranslateTool. This is a tool located in the Tools Window.

* In the Tool Bar

  * Click the |translategizmo| button
* :ref:`Select the BlueSquare object<SelectObjectGAM100>`



You should see colored arrows and a small white box:

|LWTranslating|

These arrows lay on the X (red), Y (green) and Z (blue) axes of object.

* Click and drag along one of these colored arrows to move the object along one of the axes
* Click and drag the mouse from the white box in the center to translate on all axes at once

Notice that in the Properties Window, the Translation values are changing while you move the object.

Rotate Tool
-----------

The RotateTool is used to rotate objects.

 |LWRotatingWeb|


|LWRotatingBook|




* In the Tool Bar

  * Click the |rotategizmo| button
* Click on one of the circles (red, blue and green circles) and drag the mouse.

This rotates the object around its X (red), Y (green), or Z (blue) axes. In 2D, we usually just rotate around the Z-axis.



Scale Tool
----------

The ScaleTool tool is used to scale objects.

|LWScaling|

* In the Tool Bar

  * Click the |scalegizmo| button

Colored lines with Boxes at the tips with a white box in the center will be drawn from the object.

* Click and drag along the colored axes
* Click and drag the mouse from the white box in the center to scale on all axes at once

This scales the object along its X (red), Y (green), or Z (blue) axes.

Notice that in the Properties Window, the Scale values are changing while you scale the object.

Manipulator Tool \& Area Component
----------------------------------

* :ref:`Select the BlueSquare object<SelectObjectGAM100>`
  
  * In the Properties Window

    * Under Sprite

      * Set SpriteSource to: ``SquareBordered``

    * Under Transform
    
      * Set Scale to: [5,1,1]
    


You may notice that the borders of the sprite are stretched.

 |skewedBorderWeb|


|skewedBorderBook|
  

To create crisp borders, we can add the Area Component and scale via the manipulator tool.

* :ref:`Select the BlueSquare object<SelectObjectGAM100>`

  * In the Properties Window
    
    * Under Transform
    
      * Set Scale to: [1,1,1]
    
    * :ref:`Add the Area component <AddComponentGAM100>`
    
    |AreaComponent|
        
* In the Tool Bar 
    
  * Click the |manipulatorgizmo| button    
* :ref:`Select the BlueSquare object<SelectObjectGAM100>`



You'll see points in which you can grab to change the scale of the object:

|BSManipulatorGizmo|

You can see that scaling no longer affects the borders:

 |NoArtifactsWeb|


|NoArtifactsBook|
  

Now the edges are nice on our sprite. This is because the default SquareBordered sprite already has feature known as Nine-Slice Scaling enabled, here is how it works.

|NineSliceDemo|

Nine-Slice scaling is enabled through the sprite source editor which you will see in a later lesson. 

Now we know how to create, save, and run our game projects, create and copy game objects, edit a game object's properties, change a Sprite's visibility, and use the TranslateTool, RotateTool, ScaleTool, and ManipulatorTool.
