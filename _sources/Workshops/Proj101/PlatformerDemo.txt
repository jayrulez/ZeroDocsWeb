Proj 101 Demo steps
===================

A simple follow along platformer demo assembled from prebuilt components.

Making the Environment
----------------------

The first step is to make an evironment our player can move around in.

Walls
+++++

* 	:ref:`Command<ManualCommands>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`
* 	In the Properties Window

  	* 	Set Name to: Wall  
  	* 	Under :cpp:type:`Transform`
    
   		* 	Set ``Translation`` to: ``[-9.5, 0, 0]``
    	* 	Set ``Scale`` to: ``[1, 10, 1]``

  	*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	:cpp:type:`BoxCollider`

* 	:ref:`Command<ManualCommands>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`
* 	In the Properties Window

  	* 	Set Name to: Wall  
  	* 	Under :cpp:type:`Transform`
    
   		* 	Set ``Translation`` to: ``[9.5, 0, 0]``
    	* 	Set ``Scale`` to: ``[1, 10, 1]``

  	*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	:cpp:type:`BoxCollider`

Ground
++++++

* 	:ref:`Command<ManualCommands>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`
* 	In the Properties Window

  	* 	Set Name to: Ground  
  	* 	Under :cpp:type:`Transform`
    
   		* 	Set ``Translation`` to: ``[0, -5.5, 0]``
    	* 	Set ``Scale`` to: ``[20, 1, 1]``

	*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	:cpp:type:`BoxCollider`

Ceiling
+++++++

* 	:ref:`Command<ManualCommands>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`
* 	In the Properties Window

  	* 	Set Name to: Ceiling  
  	* 	Under :cpp:type:`Transform`
    
   		* 	Set ``Translation`` to: ``[0, 5.5, 0]``
    	* 	Set ``Scale`` to: ``[20, 1, 1]``

	*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	:cpp:type:`BoxCollider`


The Player
----------

Alright now let's set up the player.


* 	:ref:`Command<ManualCommands>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`
* 	In the Properties Window

  	* 	Set Name to: Player  
  	* 	Under :cpp:type:`Transform`
    
   		* 	Set ``Translation`` to: ``[0, 0, 0]``
   	
   	*	Under :cpp:type:`Sprite`

   		*	Set ``Color`` to: ``[0,255,0]``
   		*	Set ``SpriteSource`` to: ``Circle``

* :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`

If we run the game now the player will just sit where we created him. This is because the engine is not simulating any physics for it.

* :ref:`Select the Player object<ManualSelectObject>`

	* 	In the Properties Window
	
   		*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	:cpp:type:`RigidBody`
   	 	
* :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`

If we run the game the player object will now fall, but just fall through the floor.


* :ref:`Select the Player object<ManualSelectObject>`

	* 	In the Properties Window
	
		*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	:cpp:type:`SphereCollider`

		*	Under :cpp:type:`SphereCollider`

	    	*	Set ``Radius`` to: ``0.5``

* :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`

Cool we now have are player correctly resolving collision with the environment.

Input
-----

Now lets make the player move based off WASD input.

* :ref:`Select the Player object<ManualSelectObject>`

	* 	In the Properties Window
	
		*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	:cpp:type:`Orientation`
		*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	``GroundDetection``
		*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	``PlayerInput``
		*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	``PlayerMovement``

* :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`

Now using ``A`` we can move to the left, ``D`` to move to the right, and ``W`` or ``Space`` to jump.

Wall Jumping
------------

Now what if we want to add a slightly more complex feature like wall jumping to our player.


* :ref:`Select the Player object<ManualSelectObject>`

	* 	In the Properties Window
	
		*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	``WallDetection``
		*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	``WallSlide``
		*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	``WallJump``


Moving Platforms
----------------

Let's give our player something to jump on.



* 	:ref:`Command<ManualCommands>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`
* 	In the Properties Window

  	* 	Set Name to: Platform  
  	* 	Under :cpp:type:`Transform`
    
   		* 	Set ``Translation`` to: ``[0, 5.5, 0]``
    	* 	Set ``Scale`` to: ``[20, 1, 1]``

	*	:ref:`Add Component<ManualAddRemoveComponents>`	:cpp:type:`BoxCollider`
