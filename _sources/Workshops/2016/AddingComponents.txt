**Create a Sprite**

*   :ref:`Command<2016Commands>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`
        
    |MICreateSprite| 

This is what the :cpp:type:`Level` should look like:

|LWDefaultSprite|

*   :ref:`Save the project <2016SavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <2016RunTheGame>`

Nothing happens.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <2016StopGame>`
*   In the Object Window

    *   :ref:`Select the Sprite object <2016SelectObject>`

    |OWDefaultSprite|

    |pbr|
    
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Set Name to: Player

        |PWSetNamePlayer|

    *   :ref:`Add the RigidBody component <2016AddComponent>`

|PWAddRigidBodyPlayer|

`Notice the component description pop up when Rigidbody is highlighted in the auto-complete drop down menu.`

        |PWRigidBodyonPlayer|   

*   :ref:`Save the project <2016SavingProject>`  and :ref:`run the game <2016RunTheGame>`

The Player object is falling because its :cpp:type:`RigidBody`
:cpp:type:`component<Component>` is affected by the default gravity in the
:cpp:type:`level<Level>`.

.. _2016AddingComponentsComponents:

Components
----------

:cpp:type:`Components<Component>` are bits of functionality that can be added to a game object. You can see 
the three :cpp:type:`components<Component>` on our Player in the Properties window: :cpp:type:`Transform`, :cpp:type:`Sprite`, and :cpp:type:`RigidBody`. 

* :cpp:type:`Transform` gives our game object a position, rotation, and scale. 
* :cpp:type:`Sprite`, which requires a :cpp:type:`Transform`, allows us to visualize our game object.
* :cpp:type:`RigidBody` allows our :cpp:type:`Transform`'s Translation (position) and Rotation to be altered by the Physics engine. 

While these come with Zero, others we'll create ourself by coding in Zilch.
By using :cpp:type:`components<Component>` to create our game objects we can easily reuse our code to make new and different items. 
This set-up can aid you in rapid prototyping when making your own games. 

Let's imagine we are making Bats, Wolves, and Birds. You could create 3 :cpp:type:`components<Component>`:

* BatLogic
* WolfLogic 
* BirdLogic

|BadComponentsExample| 

While making them you find they have some things in common. Rather than copying
and pasting (which becomes messy fast), we can use the
:cpp:type:`component<Component>`-based engine to our advantage and rearrange our
logic. By making smaller :cpp:type:`components<Components>` of functionality, we
can factor out the code into common :cpp:type:`components<Components>`, making
it easier to share between them. For instance:

|NoBookSingleLine| |VennWeb|

|NoBookSingleLine| *The* :cpp:type:`components<Component>` *in gray are built-in to the Zero Engine*

|NoWebBegin|
|VennBook|

*The* :cpp:type:`components<Component>` *in white are built-in to the Zero Engine*
|NoWebEnd|



|ComponentExample| 

*Noticing shared functionality allows us to restructure our code*

By having these things separated you can more easily prototype and create new game objects. 


For example, say it is later decided to create a flying healthpack. By utilizing the :cpp:type:`components<Components>` already made, Flying and ChangeOtherHealth, most of the work is done.

|FlyingPowerup|

*Something we* **can't** *make with BatLogic, WolfLogic or BirdLogic* :cpp:type:`components<Component>`

:cpp:type:`Components<Component>` are meant to be generic (when plausible), in
order to allow for reuse. In many ways, :cpp:type:`components<Component>` can be 
made more generic by adding Properties to them.

In our example, we could make our DropLoot :cpp:type:`component<Component>` more generic by having a Property represent which loot is dropped. With this new property our :cpp:type:`component<Component>` could allow our Bat to drop health, while the Wolf drops a power-up, etc.

|pbr|

Let's explore a Property on the :cpp:type:`RigidBody` :cpp:type:`component<Component>`.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <2016StopGame>`
*   :ref:`Select the Player object <2016SelectObject>`
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Under :cpp:type:`RigidBody`

        *   Set Velocity to: [5, 0, 0]

This is the initial velocity that the object will have when the level starts.

*   :ref:`Save the project <2016SavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <2016RunTheGame>`

Zero Engine has a lot of built-in :cpp:type:`components<Component>`; next we'll explore the :cpp:type:`Physics effects<PhysicsEffect>`.

Physics Effects
---------------

A :cpp:type:`PhysicsEffect` is a :cpp:type:`component<Component>` that applies some sort of a force to an object. A :cpp:type:`PhysicsEffect` can be attached in a variety of ways. This effect will then perform its action every frame according to the rules of the object it is attached to.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <2016StopGame>`
*   In the Objects Window

    *   :ref:`Select the LevelSettings object <2016SelectObject>`

        |OWSelectLevelSettings|

The LevelSettings Object
------------------------

The LevelSettings object is a special object that influences the behavior of the
objects in a level. It has :cpp:type:`GravityEffect` and :cpp:type:`DragEffect`
:cpp:type:`components<Component>` by default. The :cpp:type:`DragEffect` and the
:cpp:type:`GravityEffect` both fall under the :cpp:type:`PhysicsEffect`
category.

|PWLevelSettingsPhysicsEffects|

|pbr|

DragEffect
----------

A :cpp:type:`drag effect<DragEffect>` can apply drag to an object to slow it down based upon its mass and inertia.

*   In the Properties Window

    *   Under :cpp:type:`DragEffect`

        *   ``Left-Click`` (and hold) on the  |RadialSliderButton| symbol next to the Drag property
        *   This brings up the radial slider numerical editing interface
        *   Drag the mouse in a circle around the slider to edit the numerical value

            *   Set the Drag to: 0

            |PWLevelSettingsDragZero|

*   :ref:`Run the Game <2016RunTheGame>`

Notice how the Player object falls faster now. This is because the drag is no longer slowing down objects (similar to how air-resistance would affect objects).

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <2016StopGame>`
*   :ref:`Select the LevelSettings object <2016SelectObject>`
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Under :cpp:type:`DragEffect`

        *   Set Drag to: 10

*   :ref:`Run the Game <2016RunTheGame>`

Notice how the Player object falls slower now as a result of the increase in drag. Let's set it back to what its original value was.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <2016StopGame>`

|pbr|

*   :ref:`Select the LevelSettings object <2016SelectObject>`
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Under :cpp:type:`DragEffect`

        *   Set Drag to: 0.7

*   :ref:`Save the project <2016SavingProject>` 

GravityEffect
-------------

In real-world physics, we calculate a force with the equation: **Force = Mass * Acceleration**. A :cpp:type:`gravity effect<GravityEffect>` will apply a mass-less force to an object. This means that the object's mass is ignored (treated as 1.0 in the equation).

*   :ref:`Select the LevelSettings object <2016SelectObject>`
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Under :cpp:type:`GravityEffect`

        *   Set Direction to: [0, 0, 0]

            |PWLevelSettingsGravityDirectionless|

*   :ref:`Save the project <2016SavingProject>` 
*   :ref:`Run the game <2016RunTheGame>`

Notice that the Player object does not fall but the initial velocity set on the :cpp:type:`RigidBody` :cpp:type:`component<Component>` is still applied.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <2016StopGame>`

|pbr|

*   :ref:`Select the LevelSettings object <2016SelectObject>`
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Under :cpp:type:`GravityEffect`

        *   Set Direction to: [0, -1, 0]
        *   Set Strength to: 30

The Strength property is the magnitude of the gravitation force.

RigidBodies and Colliders
-------------------------

A :cpp:type:`RigidBody` by itself is a movable point cloud that cannot collide
with anything. Dealing with the physics of an object, :cpp:type:`RigidBody`
defines the linear and angular velocity of an object as well as its force and
torque (rotation force). It also works in conjunction with the associated
:cpp:type:`Collider` of the object to determine material density and the volume
when doing mass-based calculation such as the inertia of the object. Basically,
the :cpp:type:`RigidBody` :cpp:type:`component<Component>` deals with movement
of the object. 

*   :ref:`Select the Player object <2016SelectObject>`
*   In the Tools Window

    *   Select the TranslateTool from the drop down selection
    *   Set Snapping to: True

        |TWTranslateSnapping|

*   Hold the ``Ctrl`` key on the keyboard and then drag the Player object downward along the y-axis until its Translation is [0, -5, 0]

Holding the ``Ctrl`` key and then dragging an object with the TranslateTool will create a copy of the selected object.

*   :ref:`Select the newly created object <2016SelectObject>` (copied from the Player object)

*   In the Properties Window

    *   Set Name to: Ground

    *   Under :cpp:type:`Transform`
        
        *   Set Scale to: [8, 1, 1]
    
    *   Under :cpp:type:`RigidBody`

        *   Set DynamicState to: Static

|pbr|

Static objects cannot be moved by collisions, forces or velocity changes.

Here is how the :cpp:type:`level<Level>` should look:

|NoBookSingleLine| |LWPlayerAndGroundWeb|

|NoWebBegin|
|LWPlayerAndGroundBook|
|NoWebEnd|

*   :ref:`Save the project <2016SavingProject>`  and :ref:`run the game <2016RunTheGame>`

The Player object falls through the Ground object.

Collision Between Objects
-------------------------

In order to make collisions work, we need to add the :cpp:type:`Collider`. The
:cpp:type:`RigidBody` :cpp:type:`component<Component>` alone cannot determine
the edges of the shape, so the movement works as if all your objects are ghosts.
Once you add a :cpp:type:`collider<Collider>`, it can determine when collisions
happen and have things push back. Let's see it in action.


*   :ref:`Stop the Game <2016StopGame>`
*   :ref:`Select the Ground object <2016SelectObject>`
*   In the Properties Window

    *   :ref:`Add the BoxCollider component <2016AddComponent>`

        |PWGroundAddBoxCollider|

*   :ref:`Select the Player object <2016SelectObject>`

*   In the Properties Window

    *   :ref:`Add the BoxCollider component <2016AddComponent>`

        |PWPlayerAddBoxCollider|

*   :ref:`Save the project <2016SavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <2016RunTheGame>`

The Player object should fall and land on the Ground object as shown:

|NoBookSingleLine| |LWCollisionWeb|

|NoWebBegin|
|LWCollisionBook|
|NoWebEnd|

.. Warning:: 

    Physics will not check for collisions between two Static objects.
    
    Static Objects include:
    
    *   Objects that have a :cpp:type:`Collider`, but *do not possess a* :cpp:type:`RigidBody`.
    *   Objects with a :cpp:type:`RigidBody` that has its DynamicState set to Static.
    
    **Moving** :cpp:type:`Colliders<Collider>` **that don't have**
    :cpp:type:`RigidBodies<RigidBody>` **during run-time will cause performance
    to drop drastically.** Therefore, avoid moving :cpp:type:`Colliders<Collider>` that don't have
    :cpp:type:`RigidBodies<RigidBody>`; if you must, use a :cpp:type:`RigidBody`
    with its DynamicState set to Static. By using a :cpp:type:`Rigidbody` marked
    Static, you greatly increase performance and retain the option to change it
    to Dynamic or Kinematic, should you later need collision with other Static
    objects.

IgnoreSpaceEffects
------------------

Every once in a while there is an object you want to be an exception to the rule, e.g. implementing anti-gravity boots. A quick way to make an exception to the applied :cpp:type:`physics effects<PhysicsEffect>` is to add the :cpp:type:`IgnoreSpaceEffects` :cpp:type:`component<Component>`. Let's try it out.


*   :ref:`Select the Player object <2016SelectObject>`
*   In the :cpp:type:`Level` Window

    *   Press ``2`` to select the TranslateTool 
    *   Hold the ``Ctrl`` key on the keyboard and then drag the Player object upward along the y-axis until its Translation is [0, 1.5, 0]
*   :ref:`Select the newly created object <2016SelectObject>` (copied from the Player object)

|pbr|

*   In the Properties Window

    *   Set Name to: Player2
    *   :ref:`Add the IgnoreSpaceEffects component <2016AddComponent>`
    *   Under :cpp:type:`IgnoreSpaceEffects`
    
        *   Set IgnoreDrag to: True
        *   Set IgnoreGravity to: True
    
|PWPlayer2| 
        
*   :ref:`Save the project <2016SavingProject>`  and :ref:`run the game <2016RunTheGame>`

|LWIgnoreSpaceEffects|  

Player2 should be unaffected by the LevelSettings' effects. Now you have the basic concept behind :cpp:type:`component<Component>`-based design, learned to create a Sprite with a :cpp:type:`Rigidbody` and :cpp:type:`Collider`, found out where default :cpp:type:`physics effects<PhysicsEffect>` came from and how to ignore, them while looking into the LevelSettings object.
