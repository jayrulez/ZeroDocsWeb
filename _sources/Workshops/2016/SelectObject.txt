Selecting an Object
-------------------

.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

When an object is selected it allows you to perform extra functions on it, such
as Copy or Cut, or view its properties in the Properties Window. This is done in
one of three ways:

1. Click on the object in the Level Window
  
  |SelectLevelWindow| 
  
*Notice orange outline around selected object*

|pbr|

2. Search for the object by name in the Search Window
  
  |SelectSearchCog|  
  
*Notice the term Cog is used to describe it*

3. Click on the object in the Objects Window
  
  |SelectObjectWindow|
  
When an object has recently been selected, you may also select it via the
navigation bar in the Properties Window using the arrows or Recent button:

Selecting Multiple Objects

You may also select more than one object at the same time. With multiple objects
selected, you may Copy or Cut them all simultaneously, or view and edit the
properties on any components that they all share. Multi-selecting may be done in
three different ways:

1. Click the Left Mouse Button in the Level Window and Drag over all the objects
   you wish to select

3. Hold the Shift key and click on the first and last objects in a desired range
   in the Objects Window
