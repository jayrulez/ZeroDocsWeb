Archetypes
==========

.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

This lessons covers the creation and use of archetypes.

Archetypes
----------

An archetype in the Zero Engine (also known as a blueprint, prefab, or template
in other engines) is a collection of components and their settings which is used
to create objects. All of the objects created from a certain archetype start
with the same data, but any changes to that data after their creation do not
affect the archetype. One benefit of archetypes is that any changes to the
archetype affect all of the objects you have created from it. We are going to
create some archetypes so that we can use them to create objects later.

Create a New Project
--------------------

:ref:`CreateNewProject2015`

Adding a Pickup ZilchScript
---------------------------

:ref:`Add a new ZilchScript resource<ResourceAdding2015>` named: 'Pickup' 

Update your script to look like this:

.. code-block:: as
    
    class Pickup : ZilchComponent
    {
        [Property]
        var Points : Integer = 0;
    }

Creating an Object
------------------

* :ref:`Command<Commands2015>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`

* In the Properties Window

  * Set Name to: ``Pickup``
    
  * Under Sprite

    * Set Color to : Yellow [ R: 255, G: 255, B: 0, A: 1.00 ]       
        
  * :ref:`Add the Component Pickup <AddComponent2015>`

    * Under Pickup 
        
      * Set Points to 100

Here's what your object should look like:

|NoBookSingleLine| |PickupSettingsWeb|

|NoWebBegin|
|PickupSettingsBook|
|NoWebEnd|

Why Archetypes?
---------------

.. sidebar:: Archetypes are Resources
    
    An archetype is an example of a *resource*. Remember, resources are shared by
    everything in the project. Just as two cogs' Sprite components might share the
    same SpriteSource resource, and modifying that SpriteSource will affect both
    cogs, so too might two objects be instances of the same Archetype resource ---
    changes to the archetype will impact every instance thereof.

Imagine we were to copy and paste this object many times throught the level.
What happens if we want to change the value of this pickup? We would have
to find all pickups in the level and change their ``Points`` values. Even with
multiselect we might miss a few or there might be pickups on other levels.
Archetypes will allow us to change all pickups at once.

|pbr|

Let's create our first Archetype.

* :ref:`Select the Object <SelectObject2015>`
 
* In the Properties Window
 
  * Set the Archetype Name to: ``Pickup``
    
  * |SetArchetypeName|
 
  * Press the green Upload to Archetype button  |Upload| 

This object is now **Archetyped**. 

Creating Multiple Objects
-------------------------
Copy and paste the object multiple times.

|Copied| 


Changing Archetyped Objects
---------------------------

Let's change the property values of one of the pickups. Say
that we want it to be more of a gold color and worth more points.

* In the Properties Window
    
  * Under Sprite

    * Set Color to : Gold [ R: 255, G: 200, B: 0, A: 1.00 ]
        
    * Set SpriteSource to: Circle
        
  * Under Pickup
    
    * Set Points to: 200

|pbr|

Notice that object now looks like this:

|BeforeUpload|


Notice, in the Properties Window, the Archetype property looks like this:


|Modified|

`Notice the` ``(*)`` `after the word Archetype`

This means the object is **modified from archetype**. This object has
local changes that are not part of the archetype. The Archetype property
has two buttons now: the |Revert| Revert to Archetype button and the |Upload|
Upload to Archetype button. The Revert button will remove the local changes.
The Upload button will take the local changes and apply them to all archetyped
objects.

|pbr|

Uploading to Archetype
-----------------------

* In the Properties Window

* Press |Upload| Upload button.

|Uploaded|

Notice all the objects have now changed to be the same. Check to see that
both the color and the ``Points`` under Pickup have changed. This change would
modify all archetyped objects in **all levels** to the new values.


Reverting to Archetype
----------------------

* In the Properties Window
    
  * Under Sprite

    * Set Color to: White [ R: 255, G: 255, B: 255, A: 1.00 ]
     
|NoBookSingleLine| |PreRevertWeb|

|NoWebBegin|
|PreRevertBook|
|NoWebEnd|   

After testing it out we determine we like what we had before, so press the
|Revert| Revert button to revert the object to gold.

|NoBookSingleLine| |Uploaded|

|pbr|

Created Archetypes can be found in the Library. 

* In the Library Window

|LibraryWindow|

* ``Double-Click`` on the ``Archetypes`` Tag

|ArchetypeTag|

* Select the ``Pickup`` archetype

|SelectingPickup|

`Notice the property grid shows you the archetyped object.`

*  Drag the archetype from the library onto the game window.

This creates an instance of your archetyped object. This allows you to quickly
populate your levels with objects you have already set up.
