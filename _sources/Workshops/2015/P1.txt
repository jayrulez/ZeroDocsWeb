.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

Here is a chance for you to take what you've learned and make something cool.

Make a Rube Goldberg Machine!

What You Know
-------------

After completing chapters 1-7 you know how to:

* How to create, move, rotate, and scale Sprite-based objects.
* How to make objects collide with one another.
* How to make objects be

  * slippery or sticky (friction)
  
  * elastic or inelastic (restitution)
  
  * dense or sparse (density).
* How to make text.
* How to apply PhysicsEffects to regions and Levels

  * changing drag and gravity
  
  * making wind, vortices, and currents (FlowEffect).

Core Goals
----------

* Making objects of different shapes and sizes
* Colliding objects
* Basic Physics Material use
* Use of PhysicsEffects

Stretch Goals
-------------

Remember, while the thirst to learn is great, the point of this project (and all of them) is to go `in depth` with what you know now, be creative, and see what you learned can be used for. If you are overflowing with ideas, feel free to make multiple projects. Embrace this time to experiment, try out ideas, explore concepts, and solidify your knowledge. This is where cool game ideas come from, playing with what's possible.
