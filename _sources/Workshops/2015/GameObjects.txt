Game Objects
============

.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

This lesson focuses on putting the editor to use in order to perform various tasks: creating objects, running the game, searching, and manipulating objects by scaling, rotating, translating, and using the Area component, and the effects of the ParentingTool.


Create a New Project
--------------------

:ref:`CreateNewProject2015`

Level Setup
-----------

Here is our new empty level:

|NoBookSingleLine| |EmptyLevelWeb|


|NoWebBegin|
|EmptyLevelBook|
|NoWebEnd|

The level is not actually empty because there is a Camera object (notice the
|CameraIcon|
in the Level window) as well as other objects that come with a level by default:

|DefaultObjects|

|pbr|

Create a Game Object
--------------------

* Select Menu :menuselection:`Create --> Create Transform`
  
  |MICreateTransform|

Notice that the Transform object can be found in the Objects Window:

  |OWNewTransform|

* In the Objects Window

  * Click on the Transform object
* If the Properties Window is not visible, then enter the Command: ``Properties`` in the Search Window. 
  (Remember you can open the Search Window from any where in the engine using ``Ctrl+Shift+Space``.)

The properties of the Transform object can be found in the Properties Window:

  |PWTransform|

* In the Properties Window

  * Click on the |UnderArrow| next to the Transform component
    
  |pbr|
  
This displays the properties of the Transform component:

.. sidebar:: "Under"
 
 When accessing properties using the |UnderArrow| we use the term "Under". For instance:
 
 * In the Properties Window

   * Under the Transform Component
     
     * Set Scale To: [2, 2, 1]
      
 You would have to press the |UnderArrow| to see the Scale Property that is listed **under** the Transform component.

|PWTransformContents|

The Transform component provides the Translation (position), Rotation, and Scale of an object. 


An object has been created at the center of the level, but we can't see it yet. Let's add a visual component to our game object.

Adding a Component
------------------

* In the Properties Window

  * Click the |AddComponentButton| button 

This brings up the Add Component drop down:

|AddComponentDropDown|

* Start typing: “Sprite”

|pbr|

The Sprite component should appear in the drop down selection:

|SpriteComponentSearch|

* Click on Sprite to add a Sprite component

In the Properties Window, we can see that the Transform object now has a Sprite component:

|PWTransSprite|

You can also add components to a selected object by using the hotkey ``Ctrl+M``.

.. sidebar:: Camera Controls
    
    `Pan:` 
    
    * Middle Mouse Button + Drag
    * E + Left Mouse Button + Drag
    * E + Right Mouse Button + Drag
    * Arrow Keys
    * WASD
    
    `Zoom:` 
    
    * Scroll Wheel
    * Shift + Middle Mouse Button + Drag (up/down)
    
    with an object selected:
    
    * Double Tap F
    
    `Rotate (In Mode3D):`
    
    * Right Mouse Button + Drag
    * Q + Left Mouse Button + Drag
    * Q + Middle Mouse Button + Drag
    
    |NoBookSingleLine| :ref:`Switching Mode2D/Mode3D <SwitchingMode2Dto3D2015>`

|pbr|

The Sprite component provides a 2D visual representation of the Transform object. In the Level Window, we can see the Transform object's Sprite:

|DefaultSprite|

The question mark is the visual representation of the Sprite object known as a **SpriteSource**. We won't go into much detail about what exactly is a SpriteSource and how they work just yet. Instead, we just need to know that the square with the question mark inside is the DefaultSprite.

Changing the Name of an Object
------------------------------

* In the Objects Window
  
  * Select the Transform object by clicking on it
  
  |OWSelectTransform|

* In the Properties Window

  * Set Name to: Square

    |NoBookSingleLine| |PWSetNameSquareWeb|
    |NoWebBegin| |PWSetNameSquareBook| |NoWebEnd|

  |pbr|

  * Under Sprite

    * Set SpriteSource to: Square

    |PWSetSSToSquare|

Making a Copy of an Object
--------------------------

* :ref:`Select the Square object <SelectObject2015>`
* Duplicate it:
 
  * Press ``Ctrl+C`` to copy it 
  * Press ``Ctrl+V`` to paste a new copy
    

Notice how there are 2 Square objects in the Objects Window,
but we only see one in the Level Editor.

* :ref:`Select a Square object <SelectObject2015>`
* In the Properties Window

  * Set Name to: BlueSquare
  * Under Transform

    * Set Translation to: [5, 0, 0]
  * Under Sprite

    * Click on the |PWColorProperty| Color property

|pbr|

The following window should appear:

|ColorPickerRed|


    * Set Color to: [R:0, G:128, B:255, A:1.00]

      |ColorPickerBlue|

    * Click the OK button

The level should look like this:

|LWWhiteAndBlueSquare|

|pbr|

Running the Game
----------------

There are multiple ways to run the game in the editor.

1. Press ``F5`` key on the keyboard 
2. Press the |TBPlayButton| button 
3. :ref:`Command<Commands2015>` : ``PlayGame`` or :menuselection:`Project --> Play Game`

* :ref:`Save the project <SavingProject2015>` and :ref:`run the game <RunTheGame2015>`

Here is how the game should look:

|NoBookSingleLine| |GWWhiteAndBlueSquareWeb|

|NoWebBegin|
|GWWhiteAndBlueSquareBook|
|NoWebEnd|

* :ref:`Stop the Game <StopGame2015>`

|pbr|

Changing Visibility
-------------------

We are able to choose whether or not a sprite is visible when the level starts by setting the Sprite component's Visible property to True or False.


* :ref:`Select the Square object<SelectObject2015>`

.. sidebar:: "Set ... to: True" "Set ... to: False"
    
    Many properties are simply flags that mark something as on or off, true or false. In the Zero Engine these types of properties are shown as a checkbox.

    Those checked are **True**, those unchecked are **False**.
    
    |Checkboxes|
    
    *Notice SelectChildren is set to: False and SelectRoot is set to: True*

* In the Properties Window

  * Under Sprite

    * Set Visible to: False

   |MakeInvisible|

* :ref:`Save the project <SavingProject2015>` and :ref:`run the game <RunTheGame2015>`

The Square object is not visible, but keep in mind that it is indeed still there.

* :ref:`Stop the Game <StopGame2015>`
* :ref:`Select the Square object<SelectObject2015>`
* In the Properties Window

  * Under Sprite

    * Set Visible to: True
        
|pbr|
        
Translate Tool
--------------

Another way to move objects around in the editor is by using the TranslateTool. This is a tool located in the Tools Window.

* In the Tool Bar

  * Click the |translategizmo| button
* :ref:`Select the BlueSquare object<SelectObject2015>`

You should see colored arrows and a small white box:

|LWTranslating|

These arrows lay on the X (red), Y (green) and Z (blue) axes of object.

* Click and drag along one of these colored arrows to move the object along one of the axes
* Click and drag the mouse from the white box in the center to translate on all axes at once

Notice that in the Properties Window, the Translation values are changing while you move the object.

Rotate Tool
-----------

The RotateTool is used to rotate objects.

|NoBookSingleLine| |LWRotatingWeb|

|NoWebBegin|
|LWRotatingBook|
|NoWebEnd|

|pbr|

* In the Tool Bar

  * Click the |rotategizmo| button
* Click on one of the circles (red, blue and green circles) and drag the mouse.

This rotates the object around its X (red), Y (green), or Z (blue) axes. In 2D, we usually just rotate around the Z-axis.

Scale Tool
----------

The ScaleTool tool is used to scale objects.

|LWScaling|

* In the Tool Bar

  * Click the |scalegizmo| button

Colored lines with Boxes at the tips with a white box in the center will be drawn from the object.

* Click and drag along the colored axes
* Click and drag the mouse from the white box in the center to scale on all axes at once

This scales the object along its X (red), Y (green), or Z (blue) axes.

Notice that in the Properties Window, the Scale values are changing while you scale the object.

Manipulator Tool \& Area Component
----------------------------------

* :ref:`Select the BlueSquare object<SelectObject2015>`
  
  * In the Properties Window
    
    * Under Transform
    
      * Set Scale to: [5,1,1]
    
|pbr|

You may notice that there are some scaling artifacts that skews the borders

|NoBookSingleLine| |skewedBorderWeb|

|NoWebBegin|
|skewedBorderBook|
|NoWebEnd|  

To create crisp borders, we can add the Area Component and scale via the manipulator tool.

* :ref:`Select the BlueSquare object<SelectObject2015>`

  * In the Properties Window
    
    * Under Transform
    
      * Set Scale to: [1,1,1]
    
    * :ref:`Add the Area component <AddComponent2015>`
    
    |AreaComponent|
        
* In the Tool Bar 
    
  * Click the |manipulatorgizmo| button    
* :ref:`Select the BlueSquare object<SelectObject2015>`

|pbr|

You'll see points in which you can grab to change the scale of the object:

|BSManipulatorGizmo|

You can see that scaling no longer affects the borders:

|NoBookSingleLine| |NoArtifactsWeb|

|NoWebBegin|
|NoArtifactsBook|
|NoWebEnd|  

Now the edges are nice on our sprite. This is because the default Square sprite already has feature know as nine slice scaling enabled, here is how it works.

|NineSliceDemo|

Nine slice scaling is enabled through the sprite source editor which you will see in a later lesson.

ParentingTool
-------------

.. sidebar:: Hotkeys for tools
    
    All the numbers have been made hotkeys for the tools:
    
        +-------+-------------------------+
        | Hotkey| Tool                    |
        +=======+=========================+
        |   1   | SelectTool              |
        +-------+-------------------------+
        | **2** | **TranslateTool**       |
        +-------+-------------------------+
        | **3** | **RotateTool**          |
        +-------+-------------------------+
        | **4** | **ScaleTool**           |
        +-------+-------------------------+
        | **5** | **ManipulatorGizmo**    |
        +-------+-------------------------+
        |   6   | TileEditor2D            |
        +-------+-------------------------+
        |   7   | HeightMapTool           |
        +-------+-------------------------+
        |   8   | JointTool2D             |
        +-------+-------------------------+
        |   9   | CreationTool            |
        +-------+-------------------------+
        | **0** | **ParentingTool**       |
        +-------+-------------------------+
        
    *Notice 2, 3, 4, 5, and 0 correspond to TranslateTool, RotateTool, ScaleTool, ManipulatorGizmo, and ParentingTool respectively* 
    
* :ref:`Select the Square object<SelectObject2015>`
* In the Properties Window
  
  * Under Transform
  
    * Set Rotation to: [0, 0, 45]
      
      |LWRotatedSquare|
      
* In the Level Window
  
  * Press ``4`` to switch to the Scale Tool
  * Make the Square bigger along the green y-axis
   
    |LWScaledRotatedSquare|

You may have expected it to change into a diamond shape, but instead it created
a larger square. 

The Transform's properties always affect the object in the same way. It applies the Scale first, Rotation second, and Translation third, because of this
order of operations the scale acts as if it is scaling an object that *wasn't* rotated. 

What if that was our intended behavior? What if wanted that diamond shape? We can layer apply another Transform's set of scales, rotations, and translations by adding a parent. 

* In the Level Window
   
  * Press ``0`` to switch to the Parenting Tool
  * Left Click + Drag from the Square to the BlueSquare. 
   
    |LWParenting|
     
    *You Left Click + Drag from the child to the parent. The arrow is pointing at the new parent.*
     
    |OWParentCollapsed|  |OWParentAndChild|
     
    *You can see the Parent-Child relationship among the objects in the Objects Window*
     
  * Press ``4`` to switch to the Scale Tool
  * Make the BlueSquare bigger along the green y-axis
     
    |LWShear|
     
    *Now you can see the child Square has stretched into a diamond shape.*
     
Now it works because the scale of the parent object is applied *after* the rotation of the child object.

.. Warning::
  Beware, this **non-uniform scaling** is generally *undesirable* behavior. In graphics, non-uniform scaling makes things look warped and can introduce **artifacts** or errors. In physics, algorithms for determining if two objects collide are optimized by the shapes of the objects. By warping the shapes through non-uniform scaling the algorithms may no longer correctly apply and result in physics artifacts i.e things may collide when they shouldn't or don't collide when they should. 
  
Usually the ParentingTool is used for grouping objects together, particularly when you want them to move together. The issue of non-uniform scaling only comes up with scaling, you are free to rotate and translate without running into artifacts. 

Now we know how to create, save, and run our game projects, create and copy game objects, edit game object's properties, change a Sprite's visibility, and use the TranslateTool, RotateTool, ScaleTool, ManipulatorTool, and ParentingTool.
