.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

This lessons covers the creation and use of archetypes.

Archetypes
----------

An archetype in the Zero Engine (also known as blueprints, prefabs, or templates in other engines) 
is a collection of components and their settings which is used to create objects.
All of the objects created from a certain archetype start with the same data, 
but any changes to that data after their creation do not affect the archetype. 
One benefit of archetypes is that any changes to the archetype affect all of the 
objects you have created from it. We are going to create some archetypes so that
we can use them to create objects later. 

Create a New Project
--------------------

:ref:`CreateNewProject2014`

Adding a Pickup ZilchScript
---------------------------

:ref:`Add a new ZilchScript resource<ResourceAdding2014>` named: 'PickUp' 

Update your script to look like this:

.. code-block:: as
    
    class Pickup : ZilchComponent
    {
        [Property]    
        var Points : Integer = 0;  
    }

Creating an Object
------------------

* :ref:`Command<Commands2014>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`

* In the Properties Window

  * Set Name to: ``Pickup``
    
  * Under Sprite

    * Set Color to : Yellow [ R: 255, G: 255, B: 0, A: 1.00 ]       
        
  * :ref:`Add the Component Pickup <AddComponent2014>`

    * Under Pickup 
        
      * Set Points to 100

Here's what your object should look like:

|NoBookBegin|
|PickupSettingsWeb|
|NoBookEnd|

|NoWebBegin|
|PickupSettingsBook|
|NoWebEnd|

Why Archetypes?
---------------

Imagine we where to copy and paste this object many times throught the level.
What happens if we want to change the value of this pickup? We would have
to find all pickups in the level and change their points values. Even with
mutliselect we might miss a few or their might be pickups on other levels.
Archetypes will allow us to change all pickups at once

Let's create our first Archetype

* :ref:`Select the Object <SelectObject2014>`
 
* In the Properties Window
 
  * Set the Archetype Name to: ``Pickup``
    
  * |SetArchetypeName|
 
  * Press the green upload to archetype button  |Upload| 

This object is now **Archetyped**. 

|pbr|

Creating Multiple Objects
-------------------------
Copy and paste the object multiple times

Changing Archetyped Objects
---------------------------

Let's change the property values of one of the pickups. Say
that we want it to be more of gold color and worth more points.

* In the Properties Window
    
  * Under Sprite

    * Set Color to : Gold [ R: 255, G: 200, B: 0, A: 1.00 ]
        
    * Set SpriteSource to: Circle
        
  * Under Pickup
    
    * Set Value to 200

|pbr|
    
Notice that object now looks like this:

.. image:: images/Archetypes/BeforeUpload.png 


Notice the Properties Window the archetype property looks like this:


.. image:: images/Archetypes/Modified.png 

`Notice the` ``(*)`` `after the word Archetype`

This means the object is **modified from archetype**. This object has
local changes that are not part of the archetype. The archetype property
has two buttons now the |Revert| revert button and the |Upload| button. 
The revert button will remove the local changes. The upload button will 
take the local changes and apply them to all archetyped objects.

|pbr|

Uploading to Archetype
-----------------------

* In the Properties Window

* Press |Upload| upload button.

.. image:: images/Archetypes/Uploaded.png 

Notice all the objects have now change to be the same. Check to see that
both the color and the Points under Pickup have changed. This change would change
all archetyped objects in **all levels** to the new values.


Reverting to Archetype
-----------------------

* In the Properties Window
    
  * Under Sprite

    * Set Color to: White [ R: 0, G: 0, B: 0, A: 1.00 ]
     
|NoBookBegin|
|PreRevertWeb|
|NoBookEnd|

|NoWebBegin|
|PreRevertBook|
|NoWebEnd|   

After testing it out we determine we like what we had before, so press the |Revert|  revert button
to revert the object to gold.

|NoBookBegin| 

.. image:: images/Archetypes/Uploaded.png 

|NoBookEnd|

Created Archetypes can be found in the library. 

* In the Library Window

.. image:: images/Archetypes/LibraryWindow.png

* ``Double-Click`` on the ``Archetypes`` Tag

.. image:: images/Archetypes/ArchetypeTag.png

* Select the ``Pickup`` archetype

.. image:: images/Archetypes/SelectingPickup.png

`Notice the the property grid show you the archetyped object.`

*  Drag the object from the library onto the game window.

This creates an instance of your archetyped object. This allow you to quickly
populate your levels with object you have already setup.
