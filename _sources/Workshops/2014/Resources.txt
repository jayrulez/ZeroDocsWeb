Resources Overview
------------------

Resources are special objects shared throughout the engine, such as SpriteSources and Sounds. Changing properties of a resource affects all those game objects who reference it due to it's shared nature. Components, however, can have different properties per game object; meaning changing one does not affect the rest. Most resources are added via the **Add** command, although certain tools, such as the TileEditor2D, can create them as well. All created Resources can be found in the Library window.

Physics Materials
-----------------

Physics Materials are resources that determine the density, restitution (bounciness), and friction of an object. See :cpp:type:`PhysicsMaterial` for more information.

Friction
~~~~~~~~

Here is a diagram that attempts to briefly summarize the situation:

    |FrictionDiagram_png|

Friction is the opposing force applied, on an object touching another object, in the direction that is opposite of the direction of movement (or attempted movement). For example, in order to push a box sitting on a table, the pushing force applied on the box would be greater than the friction caused by the surface of the box being in contact with the surface of the table. The properties of the box's surface and the table's surface will determine how much resistive force (friction) will be present between them. The PhysicsMaterial's **Friction** property is a factor taken into account with the normal force in order to determine the force of friction between the two objects.

Adding a PhysicsMaterial
------------------------

*   :ref:`Command<Commands2014>` : ``Add`` or :menuselection:`Resource --> Add`
    
*   In the Add Window

    *   Select PhysicsMaterial
    *   Set Name to: Slippery

        |NoBookBegin|
        |Web100000000000016400000103A73D7D66_png|
        |NoBookEnd|
        
        |NoWebBegin|
        |Book100000000000016400000103A73D7D66_png|
        |NoWebEnd|

    *   Click the Create button

The newly created Slippery PhysicsMaterial should open in the Properties Window.

*   In the Properties Window

    *   Set Friction to: 0

        |1000000000000119000000C7453A7011_png|

*   :ref:`Select the Slope object <SelectObject2014>`
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Under **BoxCollider**

        *   Set Material to: Slippery
*   :ref:`Save the project <SavingProject2014>` and :ref:`run the game <RunTheGame2014>`

This time the Ball object slides down the Slope object faster than before. Having less friction means that a lesser amount of force is required for movement between the touching objects.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <StopGame2014>`

Restitution
~~~~~~~~~~~

The PhysicsMaterial's **Restitution** property can be thought of as the bounciness, but it is actually the value representing the percentage of energy retained when a collision happens. If an object was moving fast when it collided with another object, how much of its speed will be retained after the collision? The restitution value will contribute to the outcome of these scenarios.

The following diagram attempts to briefly summarize how the collision will be resolved in the situation where there is no restitution (bounciness):

    |RestitutionDiagram_png|

*    :ref:`Add a new PhysicsMaterial resource<ResourceAdding2014>` named: 'Bouncy' 

*   In the Properties Window

    *   Set Restitution to: 1

        |100000000000011B000000CA35EC7356_png|

|pbr|

*   :ref:`Select the Ball object <SelectObject2014>`

*   In the Properties Window

    *   Under **SphereCollider**

        *   Set Material to: Bouncy
*   :ref:`Save the project <SavingProject2014>` and :ref:`run the game <RunTheGame2014>`

The Ball object now has the **Bouncy** PhysicsMaterial instead of the **DefaultPhysicsMaterial** PhysicsMaterial, so it bounces more due to the higher restitution value. Here is the Ball object bouncing higher than previously:

|10000000000002590000016F5DBDB342_png|

High Priority
+++++++++++++

Two colliding objects will have their own restitution values based on their PhysicsMaterial, but the restitution value used will be whichever one is larger. This will be true if both PhysicsMaterials' HighPriority property is the same (both is True or both is False). If only one of the PhysicsMaterials' HighPriority property is set to True, then that PhysicsMaterial's restitution will be used.

|pbr|

Density
~~~~~~~

The mass of an object is determined by the density times the volume of the object. This means that two objects can be the same size, but if one of those objects is more dense, then that object will be "heavier" than the other. The following diagram attempts to briefly summarize the situation:

    |DensityDiagram_png|

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <StopGame2014>`

**Create SupportBlock**

*   :ref:`Command<Commands2014>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`
    
*   :ref:`Select the newly created Sprite object <SelectObject2014>`
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Set Name to: SupportBlock
    *   :ref:`Add the RigidBody component <AddComponent2014>`
    *   :ref:`Add the BoxCollider component <AddComponent2014>`    
    *   Under RigidBody

        *   Set DynamicState to: Static

|pbr|
        
**Create BalanceBar**        
        
*   :ref:`Command<Commands2014>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`
    
*   :ref:`Select the newly created Sprite object <SelectObject2014>`
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Set Name to: BalanceBar
    *   :ref:`Add the RigidBody component <AddComponent2014>`
    *   :ref:`Add the BoxCollider component <AddComponent2014>`    
    *   Under Transform

        *   Set Translation to: [0, 1, 0]
        *   Set Scale to: [10, 1, 1]
        
**Create Squares**        
        
*   :ref:`Command<Commands2014>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`
    
*   :ref:`Select the newly created Sprite object <SelectObject2014>`
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Set Name to: SquareA
    *   :ref:`Add the RigidBody component <AddComponent2014>`
    *   :ref:`Add the BoxCollider component <AddComponent2014>`    
    *   Under Transform

        *   Set Translation to: [-4.5, 7, 0]
*   Copy and Paste SquareA
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Set Name to: SquareB
    *   Under Transform

        *   Set Translation to: [4.5, 7, 0]
*   :ref:`Save the project <SavingProject2014>` 

This setup will allow us to see the results of setting an object's PhysicsMaterial to a PhysicsMaterial with a higher density.

Here is what the level should look like:

|NoBookBegin|
|1000000000000550000003DD5CEEE242_pngWeb|
|NoBookEnd|

|NoWebBegin|
|1000000000000550000003DD5CEEE242_pngBook|
|NoWebEnd|

*   :ref:`Run the game <RunTheGame2014>`

The SquareA and SquareB objects should fall and land on the BalanceBar object:

|10000000000003AB00000242822E7233_png|

The BalanceBar object does not tip over because both objects have the same volume and density, which results in the same mass.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <StopGame2014>`
*   :ref:`Add a new PhysicsMaterial resource<ResourceAdding2014>` named: 'Heavy' 
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Set Density to: 25

        |1000000000000116000000C705E018B7_png|
    
*   :ref:`Select the SquareB object <SelectObject2014>`
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Under **BoxCollider**

        *   Set Material to: Heavy

            |1000000000000119000000C2696D451D_png|

*   :ref:`Save the project <SavingProject2014>` and :ref:`run the game <RunTheGame2014>`

|pbr|

The SquareB object now has a larger density so the BalanceBar tips over:

|10000000000003F6000003051DADEB03_png|

RigidBody Setting: Rotation Locked
----------------------------------

Let's experiment with the the RigidBody component. 

What if we didn't want our BalanceBar to rotate? What would happen if it couldn't rotate?

*   :ref:`Select the BalanceBar object <SelectObject2014>`
*   In the Properties Window

    *   Under RigidBody
        
        *   Set RotationLocked to: True
        
*   :ref:`Save the project <SavingProject2014>` and :ref:`run the game <RunTheGame2014>`

|RotationLocked|

*Notice the Heavy square still bounces higher*

Because none of the energy could rotate the object the blocks landed similar to when they were of equal weight.

Now we know how to add resources, create new PhysicsMaterials, and alter the PhysicsMaterial properties and RigidBody settings that change the way objects interact with physics.
