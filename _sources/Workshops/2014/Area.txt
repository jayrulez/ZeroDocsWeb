Create a New Project

Level Setup
-----------

Create the Test Sprite

*   :ref:`Command<Commands2014>` : ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`

*   :ref:`Select the Sprite you created <SelectObject2014>`

*   In the Properties Window

    *   Set name to: AreaTest
    
    *   Under Transform
    
        *   Set Scale to: [5, 1, 1]

Why Area?
---------

Notice that the edges of the sprite are all blurry. How can we fix that?

* In the Properties Window

    * :ref:`Add the Area Component <AddComponent2014>`
    
    * Under Transform
    
        *   Reset Scale to: [1, 1, 1]    
        
    * Under Area
    
        * Set Size to: [5, 1]
        
        
Here is what it will look like

|NineSliced|

First note that Area's Size unlike scale will not be inherited by children.
        
Now the edges are nice on our sprite. This is because the default Square sprite already has feature know as nine slice scaling enabled. 

Here is how it works.
