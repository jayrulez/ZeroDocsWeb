Selecting an Object
===================
    
.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

When an object is selected it allows you to perform extra functions on it such as Copy, Cut or view its properties in the Properties Window. 
This is done in one of three ways:

1. Click on the object in the Level Window

|SelectLevelWindow| 

*Notice orange outline around selected object*

2. Search for the object by name in the Search Window

|SelectSearchCog|  

*Notice the term Cog is used to describe it*

3. Click on the object in the Objects Window
    
    |SelectObjectWindow|
    
When recently selected you may also select the object via the navigation bar in Properties Window using the arrows or recent button:
