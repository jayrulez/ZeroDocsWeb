Region and Effects
==================

.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

This section cover using regions and physics effects together.

Regions
-------

A Region is a component primarily used for trigger volumes. A region requires a collider to define what the collision volume is. When using a region as a trigger volume, the collider should probably be marked as a ghost object. One of the main features of a region is that effects attached to a region will be automatically applied to any objects with a rigid body inside of it.

Effects
-------

Effects are components that apply some sort of a force to an object. Effects can be attached in a variety of ways.

 **PhysicsSpace:** If attached to the space, an effect will apply to all objects inside of the space.

 **LevelSettings:** Same as a space, except to all objects in the level. Useful for per-level settings instead of global settings.

 **Region:** If an effect is attached to a region, it will apply to all of the objects inside of the region.

 **RigidBody:** If an effect is attached to a RigidBody and there is no Region, then the effect will be applied to the RigidBody itself.

 **Collider:** If an effect is attached to a Collider and there is no RigidBody or Region, then the effect will be applied to the nearest RigidBody parent (see Composites). This is primarily useful for creating a piece that should apply an effect based upon its position relative to its parent (A thruster object attached to a rocket).
