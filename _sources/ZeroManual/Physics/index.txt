Physics
=======

.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

Physics is a very large topic and accounts for many of the features in Zero. Do not expect to understand all the physics systems before starting on your first project as you will rarely use them all in one game.

Physics Space
-------------

*    :doc:`Get started with the Physics Space here<PhysicsSpace>`

Rigid Body
----------

Rigid Bodies are the core of our physics engine.

*    :doc:`Rigid Bodies<RigidBody>`

Collision
---------

Collision detection and resolution are useful even n game that do not appear to use physics. Use this section to learn how to get collision data and how to perform and handle conditional collision. 

*    :doc:`Collision in Zero<Collision/index>`

Physics Casting
---------------

In games we often want to pretend something physically happens to see if it is possibly before we attempt it. We will often use the practices of physics casting for this.

*   :doc:`Physics Casting Overview <PhysicsCasting/PhysicsCastingOverview>`
*   Check out raycasting lesson :ref:`here<TutorialRayCasting>`.

Physics Effects
---------------

Physics effects are components that simulate a more complicated yet commonly found effect of physics on a specific object or region or space.

*    :doc:`Physics Effects in Zero<PhysicsEffects/index>`

Joints
------

Joints allow you to define constraints for objects and how they should react to physics.

*    :doc:`Joints in Zero<Joints>`
