This page covers how to export your project.

Export to a stand alone executable
----------------------------------

For small projects this is the easiest option. It will produce an executable that should run on any windows machine

* Open your project
* Run the command ``ExportGame``
* Select a executable file name
* You are done!


Export for an installer
------------------------

If you project is very large a stand alone executable may not be the right options since it has to extract the files when it runs. 

* Open your project
* Run the command ``ExportContent``
* A folder will be opened will all the files that need to be in the installer
* The batch file will run the game with the correct flags
* Package the folder into an installer of your choice
