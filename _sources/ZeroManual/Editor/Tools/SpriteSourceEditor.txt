Frequently, when a :cpp:type:`SpriteSource` has been imported into Zero, it still needs some minor modifications; this is where the Sprite Source Editor comes into play. This can be used not only to make changes to the SpriteSource, but also to cut a SpriteSource into multiple :cpp:type:`Sprites<Sprite>` or animate a Multi-Frame Sprite.

Common Uses
-----------

*   Making small adjustments to SpriteSources 
*   Taking multi-frame SpriteSources and creating Sprite Animations

Using the Sprite Source Editor
------------------------------

Once the SpriteSource has been imported, the Sprite Source Editor can be opened by going into the Library tab and double clicking on the ``SpriteSource`` that needs to be edited. It can also be opened by clicking on the small grey arrow next to the ``SpriteSource`` Property, as seen below on the Sprite Component.

.. Sidebar:: The Origin property

    The origin of any SpriteSource can be changed by adjusting the ``OriginX`` and ``OriginY`` properties, but only if the ``Origin`` property is set to ``Custom``. If it is set to any of the preset options (``Center``, ``UpperLeft``, ``BottomLeft`` or ``BottomCenter``) then the Zero Engine will calculate the ``OriginX`` and ``OriginY`` to set the origin in the selected location. 


The Editor allows control over the base properties of each SpriteSource, such as its name, pixels per unit, and origin. The ``Origin`` property will place whichever point on the Sprite that is chosen at the coordinates chosen in the ``Transform`` Component. It is also possible to use ``OriginX`` and ``OriginY`` to set the origin in a specific spot, as opposed to one of the four preset options. All of the Sprites below, for example, have had their Origins changed while the position of their Game Objects are represented by the white Sprites.

The Editor also allows control over two very important aspects of Sprites: setting Background images and Scaling Properties of Sprites, both of which are covered in :ref:`Area Component<ManualArea>`, and creating SpriteAnimations.

.. _ManualSpriteSourceEditorAnimations:

Creating Sprite Animations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By taking a SpriteSource that has multiple frames and opening it in the Sprite Source Editor, it is possible to turn it into a moving animation. The first step is to click on ``Convert To Animation`` and make some adjustments. 

|MultiSpriteSheet|

While a majority of the information is the same as that found in the Sprite Source Editor, there are a few very important differences highlighted here:

|Comparison|

While all of these options are important, the most commonly used ones will be one or two of the first four: ``FrameWidth``, ``FrameHeight``, ``FramesPerRow``, and ``NumberOfRows``. If it's known what the Height and Width of each frame is intended to be, then by putting that into ``FrameWidth`` and ``FrameHeight`` it will calculate how many Rows to break the original image into as well as how many Frames are in each Row. Likewise by setting the ``NumberOfRows`` and ``FramesPerRow`` it will calculate what the Width and Height of each Frame should be. 

``OffsetX``, ``OffsetY``, ``SpacingX`` and ``SpacingY``, meanwhile, are used to fine tune the Animations. ``OffsetX`` will move the starting point of the first frame forward, which will also push every other frame forward by the same amount. ``OffsetY`` has a similar function, except that it moves the top of each row down by that amount. ``SpacingX`` and ``SpacingY`` do not effect the first Frame or Row, but rather adds a space in between each instead. 

At this point, if the animation is playing properly, it's simply a matter of clicking either ``Add and Close`` or ``Add and Continue`` to add the animations as SpriteSources. ``Add frames as Sprites`` will add each individual frame as its own SpriteSource, and ``Close`` will close the window and discard all work done to the SpriteSource. This assumes, however, that everything connects properly, which may not always be the case. For example:

|SpriteSheetWithEmpty|

The SpriteSource above has an empty frame at the end; if every frame is used the following animation will be produced:

|AnimationWithBlankFrame|

Obviously, this is not the desired result. Therefore, instead of choosing to use all frames, by changing ``ImportFrames`` to ``SelectedFrames`` it becomes possible to choose only the frames wanted, which will then be placed in the order the frames are chosen. 

|ChoosingFrames|

Selecting the frames in this order will leave out the blank frame at the end, and create a SpriteAnimation of the remaining frames in their chosen order. 

|AnimationWithoutBlankFrame|

If your SpriteSource doesn't have a blank background, it's possible to use the Sprite Importer to erase the background color. Simply set the ``AlphaColor`` Property to the color that needs to be erased (this is the perfect application for the EyeDropper tool), and set ``UseAlphaColorKey`` to True. On importing the Sprite, the color chosen will be erased.
