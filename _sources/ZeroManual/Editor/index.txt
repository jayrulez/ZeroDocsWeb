.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

Many new users will often make the mistake of calling the editor the engine. The engine however can function completely with out the editor and often is just manipulating data that the engine uses. Think of it like a car engine, the steering wheel is part of the car but not part of the engine.

The Launcher
