.. _LauncherDiscoverTab:

The Discover Tab
----------------

|DiscoverBanner|

The first thing you will see when you open the Launcher is the **Discover** tab.

The Discover tab is the Launcher's information hub, featuring links to documentation,
news, and informative websites:

|DiscoverNumbered|

**1.** The **Documentation** link opens the Zero Engine documentation website.

**2.** The **Zilch** link takes you to the online manual for Zilch, the scripting language
created for the Zero Engine.
   
**3.** The **Upcoming** link shows you the Zero Engine's public task organization
page, where you can see what the Zero development team is working on.
   
**4.** The **DigiPen** link brings you to the main website of DigiPen Institute
of Technology, where the Zero Engine was born.
   
**5.** The **Q&A** link connects you to the Zero Engine's Q&A page, where you can
ask questions the Zero developers and other Zero users about the engine, the editor, Zilch, etc.

.. _LauncherProjectsTab:

The Projects Tab
----------------

|ProjectsBanner|

Next is the **Projects** tab, which you will use when you want to create a new project or open
one you've created before.

Clicking on the **New** button will bring you to the New Project subtab.

.. _LauncherNewProjectTab:

New Project
~~~~~~~~~~~

Here, you can create a new 2D or 3D Zero project.

Creating a New Project
______________________

|ProjectsNewNumbered|

 **1** Choose a template to start with --- you may choose between **Empty 2D
 Project** and **Empty 3D Project**. Both options will result in an empty Zero
 project, but with a few differences in settings.
   
   **Default Settings for New 2D and 3D Projects**
   
   +--------------------+--------------------+---------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
   | **Project Type**   | **Physics Space**  | **Editor Camera**   | **Default Camera** | **GridDraw Axis** |
   +====================+====================+=====================+====================+===================+
   | **2D Project**     | ``true``           | 2D (Orthographic    | 2D (Orthographic   | ``Z-Axis``        |

   |                    |                    | etc...)             | etc...)            |                   |
   +--------------------+--------------------+---------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
   | **3D Project**     | ``false``          | 3D (Perspective     |  3D (Perspective   | ``Y-Axis``        |
   |                    |                    | Projection,         |  Projection,       |                   |
   |                    |                    | etc...)             |  etc...)           |                   |
   +--------------------+--------------------+---------------------+--------------------+-------------------+
 
 **Physics Space** -- Default behavior for collision resolution
 
 **Editor Camera** -- Settings of the editor camera
 
 **Default Camera** -- Settings of the camera that is placed by default in each new level
 
 **GridDraw Axis** -- Perpendicular axis to the grid plane
   
   .. admonition:: Note
     
     **Remember**, even if you start with the 2D template, **you can still use
     3D elements and concepts in your game**, and vice versa. The template you
     choose simply specifies the default settings for certain properties.

 **2.** Type a name for the project in the **Name** field. (You will be notified if a
 project by the same name already exists in the folder specified in the
 **Location** field.)
 
 **3.** Specify where the project should be created in the **Location** field. The
 default path for new projects can be changed in :ref:`LauncherSettingsTab`.
   
 * You can use the **Open Path** button next to the field to browse to a
   desired folder in your operating system's Folder Selection dialog
   
 **4.** In the **Tags** field, you may give the project descriptive *tags* by typing them,
 separated by commas. Tags (which are strictly optional) are just bits of text that can 
 be used as keywords when searching for projects in the :ref:`LauncherRecentProjects`
 subtab.
 
 **5.** Specify which Zero Engine :ref:`build version<LauncherBuildsTab>` you
 wish to use to create the project in the **Build** popup menu.
 
 **6.** When you are ready, click the **Create Project** button. This will create a
 folder with the project name in the specified location containing the project
 file (*.zeroproj) and Content folder.


.. _LauncherRecentProjects:

Recent Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Moving on to projects previously created, by clicking the **Recent** button you will bring
up the Recent Projects subtab.

Here, you will see a list of the latest Zero projects that you have worked on.

  .. admonition:: Note
  
    As you will see later in this Lesson, you will be able to select exactly how many
    previous projects are visibile in the **Recent Projects** window.

|ProjectsRecentNumbered|

 **1.** Each recently-used project appears here, with its name and modified date
 shown next to a thumbnail screenshot.
 
 **2.** You may use the **Search** field to search through your recent projects,
 either by name or by tags.
 
 **3.** When you mouse over a recent project, its **Remove** button will appear,
 which you may use to remove the project from the Recent Projects subtab.
   
   * Removing a project in this way does not delete it from your computer --- it
     only removes it from this list.

When you click on a recent project, you will see this:

|ProjectsRecentSelectedNumbered|

 **1.** To open the project, click the **Launch Project** button.
 
 **2.** You may choose which installed Zero Engine build
 (:ref:`see below<LauncherBuildsTab>`) you wish to open the project in by
 selecting the desired build from the **Build** popup menu.
 
 **3.** Clicking the **Open Path** button will open the project folder in your
 operating system.
 
 **4.** To return to the list of recent projects, click the **Back** button.

And finally under the Projects tab, there's the **Browse** button.

Browse Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last option under the Projects tabs, you can use **Browse** to find a Zero project.
Clicking on the **Browse** button will open your operating system's Open dialog, 
allowing you to search for a Zero project.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _LauncherBuildsTab:

The Builds Tab
--------------

|BuildsBanner|

The last primary tab in the Launcher is the **Builds** tab.

 .. tip::  **Why Choose a Different Build?**
    
     While it may seem apparent why you would want
     to use the latest build of the engine, there are still a few
     cases where having access to previous builds can save you a
     great deal of time and frustration.
     
     * First, there may be times when a change to the engine renders your game unplayable,
       unlaunchable, or otherwise broken. While the problem can usually be fixed by
       updating your code according to the new changes, this might not be an option
       if you have to present your latest build in thirty minutes. In this case, it
       would definitely be to your benefit to revert to the last build on which your
       game ran smoothly.
     
     * Second, you may want to make some changes to an old game--one that hasn't
       been worked on in a year or two. There may very well be a number of changes
       to the engine that now break your game. As in the previous example, just revert
       back to the last build you used when you last worked on the project.
     
     * Finally, there are times when you may want to use a feature that for any
       number of reasons has been removed from the engine; it may be going under
       revision or is being replaced altogether. In either case, if you're really
       attached to that feature, just use the last build where it was still functional.

The Builds tab features a list of Zero Engine build versions that are installed
on your computer or available for download.

|BuildsNumbered|

**1.** Each build is listed in the **Build List** pane, with its build number,
release date, and tags.

**2.** Further information on the selected build can be found in the **Details**
pane.

**3.** You may use the **Search** field to search through the Build List, either by
build number or by tags.

**4.** Click the **Install Build** button to download and install the selected
build.

**5.** Click the **Uninstall** button to remove the selected build from your
computer.

.. admonition:: Note
  
  You may have **any number of different builds** installed simultaneously.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _LauncherSettingsTab:

The Settings Tab
----------------

|SettingsBanner|

Finally, there's the **Settings** tab, found by clicking the little orange
horizontal lines (which can be found to the left of the primary **Discover** tab).

Here, you can configure a number of different properties about how the Launcher
itself behaves.

|SettingsNumbered|

**1.** The **Project Settings** popup menu controls what happens when you open a
project from your operating system (i.e., by double-clicking on its icon):
   
   * ``Always open launcher`` --- opening a project will open the Launcher and
     bring you directly to it in the Recent Projects subtab
   * ``Auto run project if build installed`` --- if the Zero Engine build
     version that was used to save the project is installed on your computer,
     then the project will directly open in that version, bypassing the Launcher
**2.** The **Default Project Location** field defines the default path where new
projects will be created and saved
   
   * You can use the **Open Path** button next to the field to browse to a
     desired folder in your operating system's Folder Selection dialog
   * New projects can still be created elsewhere, by specifying a different path
     in the New Project subtab (:ref:`see above<LauncherNewProject>`)
**3.** The **Default Download Location** field defines the path to which new build
versions are downloaded and installed
   
   * You can use the **Open Path** button next to the field to browse to a
     desired folder in your operating system's Folder Selection dialog
**4.** The **Max Recent Projects** field sets how many recent projects will appear
in the Recent Projects subtab

**5.** The **Revert to default** button restores the Launcher to its default
settings

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And that concludes the Lesson on how to use the Launcher to create and open projects, install
Zero Engine builds, and change the Settings of the Launcher itself.
