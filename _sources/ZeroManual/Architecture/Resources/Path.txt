.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

The :cpp:type:`Path` resource is used as a base for the :cpp:type:`LevelPath` component. 

Using a Path
------------

The Path resource on its own has no accessible functions. Instead a LevelPath component should be attached to an object, which will make its unique instance of a path which can then be accessed and modified. See the :ref:`LevelPath<ManualLevelPath>` page for more information.
