.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

:cpp:type:`Fonts<Font>` are used to give a visual flair to any text in a project. They can make text unique, memorable and fit into the visual style of the project all at the same time. Zero can accept either OpenType font (OTF) and TrueType font (TTF).

Common Uses
-----------

*   Providing different fonts for various UI elements

Importing New Fonts
-------------------

New font resources can be added in one of two ways: the file can be either dragged and dropped into the editor window, or the Add command can be used by using :ref:`Command<ManualCommands>` : ``Add`` or clicking on the ``Add`` button, selecting ``Font`` from the resources list, and clicking on "From File".

|AddButton|

|ImportFont|

This will open a new window where the user may select the font or fonts to import. Once a font has been imported any SpriteText can change its ``Font`` property to the newly imported font.
