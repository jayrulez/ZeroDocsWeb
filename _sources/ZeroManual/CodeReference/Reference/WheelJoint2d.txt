WheelJoint2d
============

.. rst-class:: searchdescription

A joint that models a wheel with shocks. This is the 2d version of the wheel joint. This joint is used in 2d mode for increased speed and stability. The motor axis is automatically set to the z axis, as that is the only axis objects can rotate upon. Also, the translation on the z axis is ignored so that objects can be arbitrarily far apart. Add on definitions: Limit: A limit will provide a min/max angle on the motor axis. Motor: A motor will turn the objects about the motor axis. Spring: A spring will make the shock axis springy. A spring is attached by default to a wheel.

Properties
----------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog WheelJoint2d::Owner

            Get the Object this component is owned/composed. Not the parent of this composition.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Space WheelJoint2d::Space

            The Space where the object is located.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog WheelJoint2d::LevelSettings

            Get the object named'LevelSettings', a special object where we can put components for our level.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: GameSession WheelJoint2d::GameSession

            Get the GameSession that owns us and our space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool WheelJoint2d::Active

            Determines if this joint is currently active. Used for runtime enabling/disabling of joints.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool WheelJoint2d::SendsEvents

            Determines if this joint will send any events. Used for a small efficiency boost and for reducing the number of events.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool WheelJoint2d::AutoSnaps

            Determines if this joint will automatically delete itself if it reaches the max force value. This will still send an event if it snaps.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool WheelJoint2d::CollideConnected

            Determines if the two objects connected by this joint can collide. If any joint between this pair does not collide, then the pair does not collide. All joints have to be set to true in order to have the objects collide.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real WheelJoint2d::MaxForce

            The maximum force that this joint can apply to correct itself.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 WheelJoint2d::LocalPointA

            The local point of the anchor on object A.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 WheelJoint2d::LocalPointB

            The local point of the anchor on object B.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 WheelJoint2d::WorldPointA

            The position of the anchor on object A in world space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 WheelJoint2d::WorldPointB

            The position of the anchor on object B in world space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Quat WheelJoint2d::LocalAngleA

            The rotation on object A that is being aligned to.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Quat WheelJoint2d::LocalAngleB

            The rotation on object B that is being aligned to.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 WheelJoint2d::WorldShockAxis

            The shock axis of the wheel in world space.

Methods
-------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: void WheelJoint2d::DebugDraw()

            Draws the debug info associated with this joint.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: Cog WheelJoint2d::GetOtherObject(Cog cog)

            If the passed in object is ObjectA, returns ObjectB. Prevents the user from having to write the if case all the time.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: Cog WheelJoint2d::GetCog(uint index)

            Returns the cog associated with an index. Index of 0 is ObjectA, index 1 is ObjectB. Used to write more streamline functions where you index into the objects in a loop.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: void WheelJoint2d::SetWorldPointsVec3

            Sets the position of the anchor on object A and B given a position in world space
