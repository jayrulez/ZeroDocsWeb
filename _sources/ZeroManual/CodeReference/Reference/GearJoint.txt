GearJoint
=========

.. rst-class:: searchdescription

A gear connects two joints on two objects together. Either joint can be a prismatic or a revolute. A gear ratio is used to bind the two joints together. Limits, motors and springs should most likely not be used on this.

Properties
----------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog GearJoint::Owner

            Get the Object this component is owned/composed. Not the parent of this composition.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Space GearJoint::Space

            The Space where the object is located.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog GearJoint::LevelSettings

            Get the object named'LevelSettings', a special object where we can put components for our level.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: GameSession GearJoint::GameSession

            Get the GameSession that owns us and our space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool GearJoint::Active

            Determines if this joint is currently active. Used for runtime enabling/disabling of joints.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool GearJoint::SendsEvents

            Determines if this joint will send any events. Used for a small efficiency boost and for reducing the number of events.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool GearJoint::AutoSnaps

            Determines if this joint will automatically delete itself if it reaches the max force value. This will still send an event if it snaps.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool GearJoint::CollideConnected

            Determines if the two objects connected by this joint can collide. If any joint between this pair does not collide, then the pair does not collide. All joints have to be set to true in order to have the objects collide.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real GearJoint::MaxForce

            The maximum force that this joint can apply to correct itself.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real GearJoint::Ratio

            The gear ratio that the two constraints are bound with.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real GearJoint::Constant

            The initial offset of the gear ratio.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog GearJoint::JointA

            

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog GearJoint::JointB

Methods
-------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: void GearJoint::DebugDraw()

            Base debug draw for a component. Special for the each type of component.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: Cog GearJoint::GetOtherObject(Cog cog)

            If the passed in object is ObjectA, returns ObjectB. Prevents the user from having to write the if case all the time.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: Cog GearJoint::GetCog(uint index)

            Returns the cog associated with an index. Index of 0 is ObjectA, index 1 is ObjectB. Used to write more streamline functions where you index into the objects in a loop.
