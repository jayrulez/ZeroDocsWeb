Properties
----------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: String PhysicsMaterial::Name

            Name of resource for display.

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsMaterial::Density

            Density is used to determine the mass of an object. Mass can be computed as density volume. Density can be set to 0 exactly to produce a massless object, however this should only be done with children objects to add collision.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsMaterial::Restitution

            How much an object will bounce during a collision. Values should be in the range[0,1] where 0 is an in-elastic collision and 1 is a fully elastic collision. Note: due to solving constraints with baumgarte energy will not be perfectly conserved with restitution 1.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsMaterial::Friction

            How slippery or rough the object is. When friction is 0 the object will be completely slippery. As friction increases sliding objects will stop quicker. The friction of two object's are combined with the formula sqrt(a b).

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool PhysicsMaterial::HighPriority

            If high priority is set, this object's restitution will be used always unless the other material is also high priority. If both are high priority then the max restitution is taken.

        .. cpp:function:: Resource PhysicsMaterial::RuntimeClone()

            Clone a resource for runtime modification.
