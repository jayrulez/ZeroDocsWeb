PulleyJoint
===========

.. rst-class:: searchdescription

A PulleyJoint turn two StickJoints into a pulley via a pulley ratio. A PulleyJoint connects the two free objects of two different stick joints. These two objects will then be bound to move together via the formula length0+ ratio* length1= 0. Limits, motors and springs should not be used on a pulley.

Properties
----------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog PulleyJoint::Owner

            Get the Object this component is owned/composed. Not the parent of this composition.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Space PulleyJoint::Space

            The Space where the object is located.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog PulleyJoint::LevelSettings

            Get the object named'LevelSettings', a special object where we can put components for our level.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: GameSession PulleyJoint::GameSession

            Get the GameSession that owns us and our space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool PulleyJoint::Active

            Determines if this joint is currently active. Used for runtime enabling/disabling of joints.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool PulleyJoint::SendsEvents

            Determines if this joint will send any events. Used for a small efficiency boost and for reducing the number of events.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool PulleyJoint::AutoSnaps

            Determines if this joint will automatically delete itself if it reaches the max force value. This will still send an event if it snaps.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool PulleyJoint::CollideConnected

            Determines if the two objects connected by this joint can collide. If any joint between this pair does not collide, then the pair does not collide. All joints have to be set to true in order to have the objects collide.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PulleyJoint::MaxForce

            The maximum force that this joint can apply to correct itself.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PulleyJoint::Ratio

            The ratio between the two stick joints. The ratio is used in the formula length0+ ratio length1= 0.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog PulleyJoint::JointA

            

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog PulleyJoint::JointB

Methods
-------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: void PulleyJoint::DebugDraw()

            Draws the debug info associated with this joint.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: Cog PulleyJoint::GetOtherObject(Cog cog)

            If the passed in object is ObjectA, returns ObjectB. Prevents the user from having to write the if case all the time.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: Cog PulleyJoint::GetCog(uint index)

            Returns the cog associated with an index. Index of 0 is ObjectA, index 1 is ObjectB. Used to write more streamline functions where you index into the objects in a loop.
