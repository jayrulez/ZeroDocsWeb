    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: PhysicsCar PhysicsCarWheel::CarBody

            The PhysicsCar component that this wheel drives/operates this wheel.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsCarWheel::SpringMin

            The minimum length of the spring of the wheel. If a wheel cast hits an object at a time before min but after start then the wheel will still collide with this object but the spring forces and visuals will be at the min spring length. This is useful for putting the starting raycast position inside of the object so as to avoid tunneling but still having the wheel only visually display where it should.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsCarWheel::SpringStart

            The t value to start the raycast at. This t value is 0 at the wheel position and travels in the direction of the wheel spring direction. This value is useful to modify where the start of the raycast is in conjunction with the min flag to help ensure that the start position is never inside of an object due to tunneling.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsCarWheel::SpringMax

            The maximum length of the spring of the wheel. If the wheel hits something further away than this length(plus the wheel radius) then that object will be ignored.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsCarWheel::SideStaticFriction
