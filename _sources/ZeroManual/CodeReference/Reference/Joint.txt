Joint
=====

.. rst-class:: searchdescription

A base joint class. Joints are used to connect two objects together with some sort of a mathematical rule in terms of an object's position and velocity.

    Base Class: :cpp:type:`Component`

Properties
----------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog Joint::Owner

            Get the Object this component is owned/composed. Not the parent of this composition.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Space Joint::Space

            The Space where the object is located.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog Joint::LevelSettings

            Get the object named'LevelSettings', a special object where we can put components for our level.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: GameSession Joint::GameSession

            Get the GameSession that owns us and our space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool Joint::Active

            Determines if this joint is currently active. Used for runtime enabling/disabling of joints.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool Joint::SendsEvents

            Determines if this joint will send any events. Used for a small efficiency boost and for reducing the number of events.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool Joint::AutoSnaps

            Determines if this joint will automatically delete itself if it reaches the max force value. This will still send an event if it snaps.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool Joint::CollideConnected

            Determines if the two objects connected by this joint can collide. If any joint between this pair does not collide, then the pair does not collide. All joints have to be set to true in order to have the objects collide.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real Joint::MaxForce

            The maximum force that this joint can apply to correct itself.

.. _ReferenceJointMethods:

Methods
-------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: void Joint::DebugDraw()

            Draws the debug info associated with this joint.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: Cog Joint::GetOtherObject(Cog cog)

            If the passed in object is ObjectA, returns ObjectB. Prevents the user from having to write the if case all the time.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: Cog Joint::GetCog(uint index)

            Returns the cog associated with an index. Index of 0 is ObjectA, index 1 is ObjectB. Used to write more streamline functions where you index into the objects in a loop.
