FlowEffect
==========

.. rst-class:: searchdescription

Applies a force to make an object move at a target speed in a given direction. This can also be used to pull the object towards the center of the flow(center of a flow is the center perpendicular to the flow direction). Used to model a river or a tractor beam.

Properties
----------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog FlowEffect::Owner

            Get the Object this component is owned/composed. Not the parent of this composition.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Space FlowEffect::Space

            The Space where the object is located.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog FlowEffect::LevelSettings

            Get the object named'LevelSettings', a special object where we can put components for our level.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: GameSession FlowEffect::GameSession

            Get the GameSession that owns us and our space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool FlowEffect::Active

            Enable/disable this effect.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool FlowEffect::WakeUpOnChange

            Whether the object associated with this is woken up when any property is changed.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: EffectType::Enum FlowEffect::EffectType

            What kind of effect this is.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool FlowEffect::LocalForce

            Determines if the flow direction is in the local space of the object.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool FlowEffect::AttractToFlowCenter

            Determines if the flow field will attract objects towards the center of the field. This can be used to create a tractor beam effect that will keep the object inside of the flow field.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real FlowEffect::FlowSpeed

            The target speed of objects in the flow field.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real FlowEffect::MaxFlowForce

            The max strength of the force that can be applied in a frame to reach the target flow speed.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 FlowEffect::FlowDirection

            The direction that the field is flowing. This can be defined in world or local space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real FlowEffect::AttractSpeed

            The target speed for an object to be pulled towards the center of the flow.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real FlowEffect::MaxAttractForce

            The max strength of the force that will pull the object towards the center of the flow field.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: void FlowEffect::Toggle()

            Toggles whether or not this effect is active.
