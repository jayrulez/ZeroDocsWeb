JointMotor
==========

.. rst-class:: searchdescription

A motor for a joint. Used to add a constant pull or push to a joint. A motor defines a desired speed to move at as well as a max force that can be applied to reach that force at any timestep. See each joint for a description of how it reacts to a motor.

        .. cpp:member:: Cog JointMotor::Owner

            Get the Object this component is owned/composed. Not the parent of this composition.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Space JointMotor::Space

            The Space where the object is located.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog JointMotor::LevelSettings

            Get the object named'LevelSettings', a special object where we can put components for our level.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: GameSession JointMotor::GameSession

            Get the GameSession that owns us and our space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool JointMotor::Active

            Determines if this motor is currently active.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool JointMotor::Reverse

            Determines if this motor should move in reverse. This is a quick hand instead of setting the speed to negative.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real JointMotor::Speed

            The desired speed for this motor. See wiki for each joint's details.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real JointMotor::MaxForce

            The maximum force that the motor can apply each frame to reach the target speed.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: uint JointMotor::AtomIds

            Signifies what atoms on the joint this effects.
