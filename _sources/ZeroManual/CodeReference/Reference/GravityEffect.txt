GravityEffect
=============

.. rst-class:: searchdescription

A constant acceleration that is applied in the given direction(mass is ignored). This is useful for creating gravity(either on the entire world or in a region) that will push/pull objects in a given direction at a constant acceleration.

Properties
----------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog GravityEffect::Owner

            Get the Object this component is owned/composed. Not the parent of this composition.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Space GravityEffect::Space

            The Space where the object is located.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog GravityEffect::LevelSettings

            Get the object named'LevelSettings', a special object where we can put components for our level.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: GameSession GravityEffect::GameSession

            Get the GameSession that owns us and our space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool GravityEffect::Active

            Enable/disable this effect.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool GravityEffect::WakeUpOnChange

            Whether the object associated with this is woken up when any property is changed.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: EffectType::Enum GravityEffect::EffectType

            What kind of effect this is.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool GravityEffect::LocalSpaceDirection

            Determines if the direction that the effect is applied is in local or world space. The length of this vector is preserved when applying the force(non-normalized vectors will change the strength).

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real GravityEffect::Strength

            An extra scalar multiplier to change the magnitude of the applied effect.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 GravityEffect::Direction

            The direction that the effect will be applied in(may be in local or world space depending on the LocalSpaceDirection property).

Methods
-------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: void GravityEffect::DebugDraw()

            Base debug draw for a component. Special for the each type of component.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: void GravityEffect::Toggle()

            Toggles whether or not this effect is active.
