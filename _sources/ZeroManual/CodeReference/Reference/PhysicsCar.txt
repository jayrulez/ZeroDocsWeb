PhysicsCar
==========

.. rst-class:: searchdescription

A controller for a high speed physics based car. The car is controlled with a steer, gas and a brake coefficient. The car will raycast wheel positions to try to keep the wheels on the ground and then apply friction and normal forces to propel the car.

Properties
----------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog PhysicsCar::Owner

            Get the Object this component is owned/composed. Not the parent of this composition.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Space PhysicsCar::Space

            The Space where the object is located.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog PhysicsCar::LevelSettings

            Get the object named'LevelSettings', a special object where we can put components for our level.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: GameSession PhysicsCar::GameSession

            Get the GameSession that owns us and our space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsCar::Steer

            How much the wheel is being steered. This is measured in radians about this object's y-axis.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsCar::Gas

            How much the gas is being pressed[-1,1] where-1 is full reverse.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsCar::Brake

            How much the brake is being pressed[0,1] where 1 is full brake.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsCar::WheelFrictionSideRollCoef

            Coefficient used to apply the side friction force closer to the car's center of mass. 1 means to apply at the wheel position, 0 means to apply at the point along the contact normal closest to the center of mass.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsCar::WheelFrictionFrontRollCoef

            Coefficient used to apply the forward friction force closer to the car's center of mass. 1 means to apply at the wheel position, 0 means to apply at the point along the contact normal closest to the center of mass.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool PhysicsCar::DebugDraw

            Whether or not the car should debug draw.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: CarWheelRange PhysicsCar::Wheels

            Returns a range of the car wheels.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsCar::MaxSpeed

            The desired maximum speed of the car. Similar to a speed governor.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsCar::MaxTorque

            The maximum torque the engine can apply to try to reach the max speed.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real PhysicsCar::GripScalar

            Artificially increases the grip of the car(where 2 is twice the grip). The total grip scalar is computed as CarGripScalar WheelGripScalar so the total car can be easily tweaked while allowing individual wheel tweaks.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool PhysicsCar::AntiLockBrakes

            Prevents the car from entering dynamic friction when applying brakes. If the brake would start to skid, the brake force is clamped to the max amount that will not slip.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool PhysicsCar::TorqueGovernor

            Governs the max torque that the engine can apply. This is used to keep the wheels from spinning out(slipping) when too high of a torque is applied. If the tires would slip, the engine will apply the maximum torque where the tires will not slip.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool PhysicsCar::Active

            Whether or not the car will run any logic at all. If this is false wheels will not work at all, they will not behave as springs or drive or anything.
