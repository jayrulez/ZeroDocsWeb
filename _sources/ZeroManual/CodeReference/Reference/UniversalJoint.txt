UniversalJoint
==============

.. rst-class:: searchdescription

A universal joint locks positional movement of two points together as well as locks rotation about 1 axis. This means it is a joint that constrains 4 axes and leaves 2 free rotational axes. This joint is most useful to model something like a arm or leg that has a nice range of rotational movement.

Properties
----------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog UniversalJoint::Owner

            Get the Object this component is owned/composed. Not the parent of this composition.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Space UniversalJoint::Space

            The Space where the object is located.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog UniversalJoint::LevelSettings

            Get the object named'LevelSettings', a special object where we can put components for our level.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: GameSession UniversalJoint::GameSession

            Get the GameSession that owns us and our space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool UniversalJoint::Active

            Determines if this joint is currently active. Used for runtime enabling/disabling of joints.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool UniversalJoint::SendsEvents

            Determines if this joint will send any events. Used for a small efficiency boost and for reducing the number of events.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool UniversalJoint::AutoSnaps

            Determines if this joint will automatically delete itself if it reaches the max force value. This will still send an event if it snaps.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool UniversalJoint::CollideConnected

            Determines if the two objects connected by this joint can collide. If any joint between this pair does not collide, then the pair does not collide. All joints have to be set to true in order to have the objects collide.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real UniversalJoint::MaxForce

            The maximum force that this joint can apply to correct itself.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 UniversalJoint::LocalPointA

            The local point of the anchor on object A.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 UniversalJoint::LocalPointB

            The local point of the anchor on object B.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 UniversalJoint::WorldPointA

            The position of the anchor on object A in world space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 UniversalJoint::WorldPointB

            The position of the anchor on object B in world space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 UniversalJoint::LocalAxis0OfBodyA

            One of the two axes in local space of object A that the objects are allowed to rotate about.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 UniversalJoint::LocalAxis1OfBodyA

            One of the two axes in local space of object A that the objects are allowed to rotate about.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 UniversalJoint::LocalAxis0OfBodyB

            One of the two axes in local space of object B that the objects are allowed to rotate about.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Vec3 UniversalJoint::LocalAxis1OfBodyB

            One of the two axes in local space of object B that the objects are allowed to rotate about.

Methods
-------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: void UniversalJoint::DebugDraw()

            Draws the debug info associated with this joint.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: Cog UniversalJoint::GetOtherObject(Cog cog)

            If the passed in object is ObjectA, returns ObjectB. Prevents the user from having to write the if case all the time.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: Cog UniversalJoint::GetCog(uint index)

            Returns the cog associated with an index. Index of 0 is ObjectA, index 1 is ObjectB. Used to write more streamline functions where you index into the objects in a loop.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: void UniversalJoint::SetWorldPointsVec3

            Sets the position of the anchor on object A and B given a position in world space
