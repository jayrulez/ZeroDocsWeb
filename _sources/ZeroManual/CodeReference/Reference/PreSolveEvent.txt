PreSolveEvent
=============

.. rst-class:: searchdescription

Event sent out from collision groups with the PreSolve block type. This event is sent out after collision detection but before collision resolution. This can be used to slightly alter the state of the two objects in a collision before they're resolved(say turn one from static to dynamic). Warning: Do not delete objects or do any other significant changes as this may destabilize the system.
