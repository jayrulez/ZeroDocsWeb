FixedAngleJoint
===============

.. rst-class:: searchdescription

Locks the orientation of two objects together. Used when two objects should always rotate in unison. Not useful by itself, but useful as a proof of concept for joints that use this functionality internally. Limits, motors and springs should most likely not be used on this. Add on definitions: Limit: A limit will provide a min/max angle on every axis that the objects must be between. Motor: A motor will attempt to drive the rotation on every axis forward. Spring: A spring will make the rotations on every axis at the bounds springy.

    Base Class: :cpp:type:`Joint`

Properties
----------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog FixedAngleJoint::Owner

            Get the Object this component is owned/composed. Not the parent of this composition.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Space FixedAngleJoint::Space

            The Space where the object is located.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Cog FixedAngleJoint::LevelSettings

            Get the object named'LevelSettings', a special object where we can put components for our level.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: GameSession FixedAngleJoint::GameSession

            Get the GameSession that owns us and our space.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool FixedAngleJoint::Active

            Determines if this joint is currently active. Used for runtime enabling/disabling of joints.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool FixedAngleJoint::SendsEvents

            Determines if this joint will send any events. Used for a small efficiency boost and for reducing the number of events.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool FixedAngleJoint::AutoSnaps

            Determines if this joint will automatically delete itself if it reaches the max force value. This will still send an event if it snaps.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool FixedAngleJoint::CollideConnected

            Determines if the two objects connected by this joint can collide. If any joint between this pair does not collide, then the pair does not collide. All joints have to be set to true in order to have the objects collide.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real FixedAngleJoint::MaxForce

            The maximum force that this joint can apply to correct itself.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Quat FixedAngleJoint::LocalAngleA

            The rotation on object A that is being aligned to.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: Quat FixedAngleJoint::LocalAngleB

            The rotation on object B that is being aligned to.

Methods
-------

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: void FixedAngleJoint::DebugDraw()

            Base debug draw for a component. Special for the each type of component.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: Cog FixedAngleJoint::GetOtherObject(Cog cog)

            If the passed in object is ObjectA, returns ObjectB. Prevents the user from having to write the if case all the time.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:function:: Cog FixedAngleJoint::GetCog(uint index)

            Returns the cog associated with an index. Index of 0 is ObjectA, index 1 is ObjectB. Used to write more streamline functions where you index into the objects in a loop.
