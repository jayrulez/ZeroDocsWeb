JointSpring
===========

.. rst-class:: searchdescription

A spring for a joint. Used to make a joint soft and therefore behave spring-like. A joint spring has a frequency in hertz at which to oscillate as well as a dampening ratio. The ratio should vary from 0 to 1 where 0 is no dampening and 1 is critical dampening. See each joint for a description of how it reacts to a spring.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: bool JointSpring::Active

            Determines if this motor is currently active.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real JointSpring::FrequencyHz

            The oscillation frequency of the spring in Hertz(cycles per second).

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: real JointSpring::DampRatio

            The dampening ratio of this spring. The value should range from 0 to 1 where 0 is no dampening and 1 is critical dampening.

    .. rst-class:: collapsible

        .. cpp:member:: uint JointSpring::AtomIds

            Signifies what atoms on the joint this effects.
