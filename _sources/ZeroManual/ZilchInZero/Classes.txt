Classes
=======

.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

Classes are a :doc:`by-reference types<Memory_Management>`  that may have functions and their own set of data members accessible by the **this** keyword.

.. code-block:: as

    // Note:
    // -class keyword is used
    // -class name must be capitalized
    class MyClassName
    {
        // Classes can have their own data 
        // Note: their names must be capitalized.
        var MyData : Integer = 0;
        
        // Constructors use the 'constructor' keyword
        constructor()
        {
        }
        function MyFunction(): Integer
        {
          // Use 'this' to access instance fields and other functions
          this.Increment();
          return this.MyData;
        }
        
        function Increment()
        {
          this.MyData += 1;
        }
    }

Constructors are similar to functions in that they can take parameters, but they always return an instance of the type they are constructing. 
Because their return type is set, the area used for a function's return type is actually used for calling parent constructors as necessary. For more, look into :doc:`Inheritance`.
