.. warning:: 
    
    Zilch does not currently have a dereferencing operator.
    
    Although you can still use the ``ref`` type with the **dot operator** to access functionality, those typed with ``ref`` will not be equivalent to the ``non-ref`` type. *Anything expecting a* ``non-ref`` *type will not accept a* ``ref`` *type without dereferencing.* Consider the following:
    
    .. code-block:: as
    
        var heapObject: ref CustomStruct = new CustomStruct();
        // The following will not compile because they are different types:
        //              CustomStruct != ref CustomStruct
        var stackObject: CustomStruct = heapObject;
