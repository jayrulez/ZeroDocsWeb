Graphics
========

.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

Graphics is arguably the most complex and important core system an engine. There are many objects that are part of or interact with the graphics engine, explore them in more detail below.

Cameras, Viewports, and Renderers
---------------------------------

The render pipeline consists of three main components, Cameras, Viewports, and Renderers.

Sprites & Text
--------------

2D games are often made with 2D assets called Sprites. Even in 3D games text, which is made out of sprites, and Sprites are still used.

*    :doc:`Sprites in Zero<Sprites/index>`

Particles
---------

In real life we often see thousands of small objects that result as an interaction of two larger objects. Modelling each dust particle as a game object if we were to drop a rock would be incredibly inefficient. Instead we use particle systems to create various effects and polish.

Lighting
--------

Lighting often is what gives a scene its unique look. In Zero there are many ways to set up the lighting for your scene.

*    :doc:`Lighting in Zero <Lighting/index>`

Materials
---------

Models and a few other systems in Zero use materials to determine what the surface of an object will look like.

Animation
