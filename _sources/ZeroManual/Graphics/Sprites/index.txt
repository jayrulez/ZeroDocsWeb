Sprites and SpriteText
======================

.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

:cpp:type:`Sprites<Sprite>` are 2-Dimensional images that can used for several different reasons in a video game. If the game is 2D itself, there's a high chance that the majority or even all of the artwork will be made using Sprites rather than 3D models. Even in a 3D game Sprites are often used for images along flat surfaces or can be "billboarded" so that the normals are always facing the camera to create a low cost image where detail is not really needed. 

Common uses for Sprites include:
    * Character animations for 2D games
    * Creating simple images or animations to be put onto flat surfaces in 3D games
    * Putting simple text into a scene in either 2D or 3D games, especially where the text needs to be changed in game
