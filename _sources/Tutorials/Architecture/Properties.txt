.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

This lesson explains the basics of creating properties in the Zero Engine.

Create a New Project
--------------------

:ref:`ManualCreateNewProject`

Adding a Player ZilchScript
----------------------------

:ref:`Add a new ZilchScript resource<ManualResourceAdding>` named: Player

Update your **Player** script to look like this:

.. code-block:: as
    
    class Player : ZilchComponent
    {
        function Initialize(init : CogInitializer)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("I am player `this.Owner.Name`");
        }

        function OnLogicUpdate(event : UpdateEvent)
        {
        }
    }

* :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>`
    
**Create PlayerOne**
  
* :ref:`Command<ManualCommands>`: ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite` 
* In the Properties Window
  
  * Set Name to: 'PlayerOne'
  * :ref:`Add a Player component <ManualAddRemoveComponents>`

It should look like this:

|EmptyPlayer|



Adding Properties
-----------------

* Go back to your script by selecting it from the library, or click the arrow next to the word Player

Update your **Player** script to look like this:

.. code-block:: as
    :emphasize-lines: 3,4
     
    class Player : ZilchComponent
    {
        [Property]
        var Health : Integer = 0;
        
        function Initialize(init : CogInitializer)
        {
           Console.WriteLine("I am player `this.Owner.Name`");    
        }

        function OnLogicUpdate(event : UpdateEvent)
        {
        }
    }

* :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>`    
* In the Properties Window

  * Under Player
  
    * Set Health to: 10

|AddedHealth|

Properties allow your scripts to add data to your game objects. Your defined
properties are just like all the other properties shown in the Properties Window such as
Translation or Scale. 

Reading Properties
------------------

Update the **Player** script to look like this:

.. code-block:: as
     
        function Initialize(init : CogInitializer)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("I am player `this.Owner.Name` my health is `this.Health`");    
        }
        
* :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`
 

 
In the Console Window output we get this::

    ---------------- Begin Game ---------------
    I am player PlayerOne my health is 10 
 
* :ref:`Stop the Game <ManualStopGame>`
 
Properties and Multiple Objects
----------------------------------

* :ref:`Command<ManualCommands>`: ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite` 
* In the Properties Window
    
  * Set Name to: 'PlayerTwo'
  * :ref:`Add a Player component <ManualAddRemoveComponents>`
  * Under Player component
    
    * Set Health to: 20

Here is what its properties look like:

|PlayerTwo|

* :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`

Notice that each object can have a different value for Health::

    ---------------- Begin Game ---------------
    I am player PlayerOne my health is 10
    I am player PlayerTwo my health is 20


Features of Properties
----------------------

* Each object has it own copy of every property variable
* Changing the value of the property on an object does not effect the value of the property on other objects
* Properties are automatically saved for every object in the level
* Properties are saved on archetypes

Other Property Types
--------------------

* :ref:`Stop the Game <ManualStopGame>`
* Add the following to your **Player script in place of the Health property** :

.. code-block:: as

    [Property]
    var Health : Integer = 0;
    
    [Property]
    var Size : Real2 = Real2(0,0);

    [Property]
    var DamageFactor : Real = 0;
    
    [Property]
    var Started : Boolean = false;
    
    [Property]
    var Text : String = "Hello";
    
* :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>`    
    
|MoreProperties|



Resource Properties
-------------------

Properties can also refer to resources. 

* Add this to your **Player** script:

.. code-block:: as

    [Property]
    var LowHealth : SpriteSource = null;

* :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>`
* Select PlayerOne    
* In the Properties Window  
    
  * Under the Player component
  
    * Set LowHealth to: a SpriteSource of your choice

|SetResourceProperty|

    
You can also change the properties of components to different values
in code:

.. code-block:: as
     
    function Initialize(init : CogInitializer)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("I am player `this.Owner.Name` my health is `this.Health`");
        
        if(this.Health < 20)
        {
            this.Owner.Sprite.SpriteSource = this.LowHealth;
        }
    }
