What Are Spaces?
----------------

In the Zero Engine, a :cpp:type:`Space` is a powerful organizational tool. It
is quite literally the world of your game. It has three *spatial* dimensions ---
X, Y, and Z --- and one *temporal* dimension --- time --- in which objects can
exist, move, rotate, collide, etc. Just about everything you do, make, or
interact with in a Zero project happens in a :cpp:type:`space<Space>`.

Level Setup
-----------

:ref:`ManualCreateNewProject`

When you make a :cpp:type:`level<Level>` in the Zero Editor, you are basically
making a list of :cpp:type:`cogs<Cog>` (and their positions, rotations, etc.)
that the engine should create. These are made in the order they appear in the
**Objects** window, and placed in a :cpp:type:`space<Space>`.

Let's set up a demonstration using a couple of spheres.

*   In the Objects Window

    -   :ref:`Select the LevelSettings object <ManualSelectObject>`

*   In the Properties Window

    -   :ref:`Remove the GravityEffect and DragEffect Components <ManualRemoveComponent>`

*   :ref:`Command<ManualCommands>` : ``CreateSphere`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sphere`
*   In the Properties Window

    -   Set Name to: ``SphereA``
    -   Under :cpp:type:`Transform<Transform>`

        +   Set Translation to: [-10, 0, 0]

    -   Under :cpp:type:`Model`

        +   Set :cpp:type:`Material` to: ``Grid``

    -   Under :cpp:type:`RigidBody<RigidBody>`

        +   Set Velocity to: [20, 0, 0]

*   **Duplicate** the object by pressing ``Ctrl + D``
*   In the Properties Window

    -   Set Name to: ``SphereB``
    -   Under :cpp:type:`Transform`

        +   Set Translation to: [0, 1, 0]

    -   Under :cpp:type:`Model`

        +   Set :cpp:type:`Material` to: ``DefaultMaterial``

    -   Under :cpp:type:`RigidBody`

        +   Set Velocity to: [0, 0, 0]

|InitialSetup|

Now we're ready to go, but before we do, let's examine what we've done, and then
make a hypothesis about what's going to happen when we run the game.

*   We have two spheres, each with :cpp:type:`SphereCollider` and
    :cpp:type:`RigidBody` components
*   The sphere on the left has an initial velocity that will send it to the
    right
*   The :cpp:type:`level<Level>` has no :cpp:type:`gravity<GravityEffect>` nor
    :cpp:type:`drag<DragEffect>`

Do you have an idea of what's going to happen? Let's run it and see.

*   :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`

|CollidingSpheres|

Naturally, the sphere on the left moved to the right and bumped into the other
sphere, causing both of them to change their velocities.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <ManualStopGame>`

Now let's change things up a bit.

Multiple Spaces, Multiple Levels
--------------------------------

The spheres in the previous example were able to collide because

*   they both had :cpp:type:`colliders<Collider>`
*   they were aligned on the Z axis

and, most importantly,

*   they were both in the same :cpp:type:`space<Space>`

Now, let's see what happens when we try to make two things collide that are in
different :cpp:type:`spaces<Space>`. Creating additional
:cpp:type:`spaces<Space>` is easy --- it's just one line of code --- but a
:cpp:type:`space<Space>` isn't much good unless you load a
:cpp:type:`level<Level>` in it. Thus, for our demonstration, we're going to need
a couple more :cpp:type:`levels<Level>`.

*   In the Library Window

    -   Under the Level tag

        +   ``Right-click`` the level called ``Level`` and select **Duplicate**
            
            |DuplicateLevel|

        +   ``Right-click`` the level called ``LevelCopy1`` and select **Rename**
            
            |RenameLevel|
            
        +   Name this duplicate: ``Foreground``
        +   ``Right-click`` the level called ``Level`` and select **Duplicate**
        +   ``Right-click`` the level called ``LevelCopy1`` and select **Rename**
        +   Name this duplicate: ``Background``

Now let's work in our new Foreground :cpp:type:`level<Level>`.

*   In the Library Window

    -   Under the Level tag

        +   ``Double left-click`` the level called ``Foreground``

As you might expect, Foreground is a perfect copy of our original
:cpp:type:`level<Level>`. Let's delete one of the spheres.

*   :ref:`Select the SphereB object <ManualSelectObject>`
*   Delete SphereB

Now let's work in the Background :cpp:type:`level<Level>`.

*   In the Library Window

    -   Under the Level tag

        +   ``Double left-click`` the level called ``Background``

Here, let's delete the other sphere.

*   :ref:`Select the SphereA object <ManualSelectObject>`
*   Delete SphereA

Making Spaces
-------------

To create a new :cpp:type:`space<Space>`, we'll have to add a new Zilch script.

*   :ref:`Add a new ZilchScript resource<ManualResourceAdding>` named:
    ``BackgroundCreator``
*   Update your new script to look like this:

.. code-block:: csharp
    
    class BackgroundCreator : ZilchComponent
    {
      [Property]
      // This is the level we'll load into the new space
      var BackgroundLevel : Level = Level.Background;
      [Property]
      // This is the archetype of space we'll use
      var SpaceArchetype : Archetype = Archetype.Space;
      
      // This is the handle we can use from elsewhere to refer to the background space
      var BackgroundSpace : Space;
      
      
      function Initialize(init : CogInitializer)
      {
        // When the level starts, create the new space and load its level
        this.BackgroundSpace = this.GameSession.CreateNamedSpace("Background", this.SpaceArchetype);
        this.BackgroundSpace.LoadLevel(this.BackgroundLevel);
      }
      
      
      // When the foreground space is destroyed...
      function Destroyed()
      {
        // ...if the background space is still around...
        if(this.BackgroundSpace != null)
        {
          // ...destroy it
          this.BackgroundSpace.Destroy();
        }
      }
    }

.. sidebar:: `ResourceType`.\ `ResourceName` vs. `ResourceType`.Find
    
    In our new BackgroundCreator :cpp:type:`component<Component>`, we created a
    couple of properties, and we set their default values using the format
    `ResourceType`.\ `ResourceName`. This is a handy shortcut for when we know
    ahead of time what we probably want to use a property for, but we want to
    leave it open to be changed later.
    
    In the first example, we could just as well have written
    
    ``Level.Background``
    
    as
    
    ``Level.Find("Background")``
    
    and it would have done almost the same thing --- the difference is that if
    the ``Find`` function fails, say, because of a typo, we won't know about it
    until the game is running, whereas `ResourceType`.\ `ResourceName` won't
    even compile if there's a typo.
    
    Of course, you can always set it to ``null`` (or not set it at all), and
    then fill it in manually afterward via the Properties Window.

A good place for a :cpp:type:`component<Component>` like this is the
**LevelSettings** object. Since this :cpp:type:`component<Component>` creates
the *background* :cpp:type:`space<Space>`, we should attach it to the
*foreground* :cpp:type:`level<Level>`, but before we do, let's run that level
*without* the BackgroundCreator, so we have a basis for comparison with what it
will look like *with* it.

*   In the Library Window

    -   Under the Level tag

        +   ``Double left-click`` the level called ``Foreground``

*   :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`

|ForegroundOnly|

It's just like before, except there's only one sphere, and understandably so,
since the :cpp:type:`level<Level>` only contains one sphere.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <ManualStopGame>`

Now let's add that :cpp:type:`component<Component>`.

*   In the Objects Window

    -   :ref:`Select the LevelSettings object <ManualSelectObject>`

*   In the Properties Window

    -   :ref:`Add the BackgroundCreator Component <ManualAddComponent>`

This new :cpp:type:`component<Component>` we have added creates a new
:cpp:type:`space<Space>` when the ``Foreground`` :cpp:type:`level<Level>`
starts, and loads the ``Background`` :cpp:type:`level<Level>` into it. Thus, we
should expect to see something like what we had before --- two spheres, one of
them moving to the right.

*   :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`

|ThatsIt|

So where's the other sphere?

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <ManualStopGame>`

As a matter of fact, it's actually there --- we just can't see it because
there's another :cpp:type:`space<Space>` in the way. We can fix that by changing
some settings on the foreground :cpp:type:`level<Level>`'s
:cpp:type:`CameraViewport` :cpp:type:`component<Component>`.

*   In the Objects Window

    -   :ref:`Select the LevelSettings object <ManualSelectObject>`

*   In the Properties Window

    -   Under :cpp:type:`CameraViewport`

        +   Set Background to: ``False``
        +   Set Layer to: ``1``

*   :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`

|NoCollision|

.. admonition:: Always Set Your Layer Order
    
    If you forget to change the :cpp:type:`CameraViewport`'s **Layer** property
    when you change its **Background** property to ``False``, you might notice
    that it still seems to work. This may be the case, but it is important that
    you **always set the Layer order explicitly** when you use multiple spaces,
    as things are not guaranteed to work the way you might expect them to work
    if you don't.

The spheres now no longer collide. This is because, although

*   they both have :cpp:type:`colliders<Collider>` and
*   they are aligned on the Z axis,

most importantly,

*   they are not in the same :cpp:type:`space<Space>`.

Layering
--------

Observe the way that the foreground :cpp:type:`level<Level>`'s sphere is drawn
on top of the background sphere.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <ManualStopGame>`

*   In the Library Window

    -   Under the Level tag

        +   ``Double left-click`` the level called ``Background``

*   :ref:`Select the SphereB object <ManualSelectObject>`
*   In the Properties Window

    -   Under :cpp:type:`Transform`

        +   Set Translation to: [0, 1, 10]

Now the background sphere is much closer to the camera.

*   In the Library Window

    -   Under the Level tag

        +   ``Double left-click`` the level called ``Foreground``

Let's also make the foreground sphere move a bit slower so we can see this
better.

*   :ref:`Select the SphereA object <ManualSelectObject>`
*   In the Properties Window

    -   Under :cpp:type:`RigidBody`

        +   Set Velocity to: [5, 0, 0]

*   :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`

|SlowNoCollision|

It seems that, even though the background sphere has a much greater
Z-translation than the foreground sphere, it is still being drawn behind it.
This is because, via the :cpp:type:`CameraViewport`'s **Layer** property, we
have specified that the :cpp:type:`spaces<Space>` that these two spheres inhabit
should be drawn in this layer order, and now Z-ordering makes no difference.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <ManualStopGame>`

Let's change the layer order and watch what happens.

*   In the Properties Window

    -   Under :cpp:type:`CameraViewport`

        +   Set Layer to: ``-1``

Now the background sphere should appear on top of the foreground sphere when
they overlap.

*   :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`

|ThatsIt|

Ah, we still need to fix the **Background** property.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <ManualStopGame>`

*   In the Library Window

    -   Under the Level tag

        +   ``Double left-click`` the level called ``Background``

*   In the Objects Window

    -   :ref:`Select the LevelSettings object <ManualSelectObject>`

*   In the Properties Window

    -   Under :cpp:type:`CameraViewport`

        +   Set Background to: ``False``

*   In the Library Window

    -   Under the Level tag

        +   ``Double left-click`` the level called ``Foreground``

*   :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`

|SlowNoCollisionNoBackground|

This is almost like before, except that the "background" sphere (it now seems
improper to call it that) gets drawn on top of the "foreground" sphere.

Also note that the background color has changed from the default dark gray to a
lighter gray. What's happening is that the backgrounds of both
:cpp:type:`spaces<Space>` are transparent --- neither :cpp:type:`CameraViewport`
has its **Background** flag set --- so we see right through the game to the
editor window behind it.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <ManualStopGame>`

*   In the Objects Window

    -   :ref:`Select the LevelSettings object <ManualSelectObject>`

*   In the Properties Window

    -   Under :cpp:type:`CameraViewport`

        +   Set Background to: ``True``

*   :ref:`Save the project <ManualSavingProject>` and :ref:`run the game <ManualRunTheGame>`

Now the background is once again being drawn with the color specified in the
**ClearColor** property of the :cpp:type:`LevelSettings` object's
:cpp:type:`ForwardRenderer` :cpp:type:`component<Component>`.

*   :ref:`Stop the Game <ManualStopGame>`

Space Components
----------------

Besides being an organizational tool where your game's :cpp:type:`cogs<Cog>`
live, a :cpp:type:`space<Space>` has a few important
:cpp:type:`components<Component>`.

*   In the Level Window

    *   Press ``Shift + S``

**Or**

*   Select Menu :menuselection:`Select --> Select Space`

Let's take a look at what we see in the Properties Window.

*   :cpp:type:`TimeSpace`

    -   Keeps track of the passage of time within its :cpp:type:`space<Space>`
    -   Can be paused/unpaused independently of other :cpp:type:`spaces<Space>`

        +   This is useful if you want to pause your game but have an animated
            pause menu
            
    -   Can have its **TimeScale** property changed to cause time to slow down
        or speed up

*   :cpp:type:`GraphicsSpace`

    -   Contains certain properties defining how things are rendered
    -   To use custom :cpp:type:`sprite<Sprite>` layering, create a
        :cpp:type:`SpriteLayerOrder` :cpp:type:`resource<Resource>` and set the
        :cpp:type:`GraphicsSpace` to use it

*   :cpp:type:`PhysicsSpace`

    -   Contains certain properties defining how things interact with each other
    -   Can be used for **ray casting**, etc.
    -   If the **Mode2D** property is set to ``True``, then all collision 
        resolution will be 2D --- that is, it will result in no position changes
        in the Z-direction, etc.
        
        +   This property may also be set in a :cpp:type:`cog<Cog>`-by-cog basis
            inside the :cpp:type:`RigidBody` :cpp:type:`component<Component>`

    -   To use a custom collision table, create a :cpp:type:`CollisionTable`
        :cpp:type:`resource<Resource>` and set the :cpp:type:`PhysicsSpace` to
        use it

*   :cpp:type:`SoundSpace`

    -   Can be used to play :cpp:type:`sound cues<SoundCue>`, etc.

*   :cpp:type:`ReactiveSpace`

    -   Contains certain properties defining how the :cpp:type:`Reactive`
        :cpp:type:`component<Component>` works

You can also add your own custom Zilch :cpp:type:`components<Component>` to a
:cpp:type:`space<Space>` --- just select the :cpp:type:`space<Space>` and click
**Add Component...** in the Properties Window, the same as with a
:cpp:type:`cog<Cog>`. Zilch :cpp:type:`components<Component>` on the
:cpp:type:`Space` are useful for keeping track of data across multiple levels,
like score, etc.

So What
-------

We've learned how to make :cpp:type:`spaces<Space>`. So why should we? What's
the point? The primary usefulness of being able to put :cpp:type:`cogs<Cog>` in
separate :cpp:type:`spaces<Space>` is in **overlaying things**.

Consider title screens, pause menus, HUDs, dialogue boxes, that sort of thing
--- each of these can (and should) be placed in a separate
:cpp:type:`space<Space>` from that of the main game. In general, no object from
your game should collide with anything in your HUD, for example, nor should
anything in your game get in front of your pause menu. You can strictly control
what goes where when you have these things separated into their own
:cpp:type:`spaces<Space>`.

We'll get into some of these more advanced applications of
:cpp:type:`spaces<Space>` a bit later. For now, let's move on to a much more
common use: **creating objects**, which we will cover in the next lesson.

Now we know how to use :cpp:type:`Spaces<Space>`.
