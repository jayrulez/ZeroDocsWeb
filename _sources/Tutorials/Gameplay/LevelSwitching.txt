Level Switching
===============

.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

This lesson, explains how to create doors that let the player move to the next level.

Create a New Project
--------------------

:ref:`ManualCreateNewProject`
    
Level Setup
-----------
*   Create a Player with swept controls

*   Create a Level for the player

Door Setup
----------
*   :ref:`Add a new ZilchScript resource<ManualResourceAdding>` named: 'Door'

*   Add the following Property to the **Door** Script

.. code-block:: as

    [Property]
    var NextLevel : Level = null;
    
There is no default level we want to go to when going through a door, so we will define the level to go to in the Door Properties in a bit.

**Door Object**

*   :ref:`Command<ManualCommands>`: ``CreateSprite`` or :menuselection:`Create --> Create Sprite`
*   In Properties Window

    *   Set Name to: 'Door'
    
    *   Add a BoxCollider Component

    *   Add a Door component
        
    *   Under BoxCollider
    
        *   Set the Ghost to: true

Level 2 Setup
-------------
        
Next we will move the player into the other level by making it an archetype.

**Player Object**

*   In Properties Window

    *   Set Archetype to: PlayerArch
    
    *   Left click the Green Upload |CP_GreenUpload| sign

Now we can create the new level.

*   In Library Window

    *   Goto Level tag
    
    *   Rename The current level 'Level1'
    
    *   Create a new level named 'Level2'

*   Create a different set of platforms for Level2

And now will will proceed to add the Player into the game.

*   In Library Window

    *   Goto Archetype tag
    
    *   Drag PlayerArch into the Level Window

Now that we have our Level2 made, we can redirect the Level1 door to Level2.

|CP3_Level2|

Go back to Level1

**Door Object**

*   In Properties Window

    *   Under Door
    
        *   Set NextLevel to: Level2

Connect player with Door
------------------------
Finally we must tell Player to load the door's Level when colliding with the door.

*   In PlayerController

    *   Add the following to an **OnCollisionStarted** event
    
    .. code-block:: as
        
        //when hitting a door, goto the next level
        if(event.OtherObject.Door != null)
        {
            this.Space.LoadLevel(event.OtherObject.Door.NextLevel);
        }
        
*   Return to Level1 and run the project
