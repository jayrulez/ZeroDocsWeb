Collision
=========

.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

Simulating collision between two objects is handled completely by the engine. As the developer you will often be working with the data resulting from detected or resolved collisions. You will also often define the rules for how objects should collide.

Collision Events
----------------

Collision Events are the primary way you as the game developer are notified of collisions. It is also the best way to get data about any said collision.
