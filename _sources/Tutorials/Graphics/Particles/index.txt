.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

Modelling a cloud of dust with individual game objects is prohibitively expensive. We use particle systems to simulate physics for effects such as dust, explosions, and fire.

Basic Particles
---------------

You can achieve simple polish with basic particle effects.

Layered Particles
-----------------

You can achive more complex feedback with layered particle systems.
