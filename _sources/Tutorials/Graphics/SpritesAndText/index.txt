Sprites & Text
==============

.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

Sprites are 2D assets used in most 2D and 2D games. We can use static sprites to display something or we can use a collection of sprites to generate a moving sprite animation.

Sprites
-------

The basics of sprites and the sprite component.

*    :doc:`Sprites in Zero <Sprites>`

Text
----

As it turns out text is generally just a collection of sprites.

*    :doc:`Sprite Text in Zero <Text>`

Area Component
--------------

Visual assets often struggle with non-uniform scaling which can result in skewed and stretched images. The Area component helps us scale special sprites with out stretching them using a concept called nine-slice scaling.

Sprite Animation
----------------

Zero has a few option on how to create and use Sprite animations. One of the most common approaches is using animated sprite sheets.
