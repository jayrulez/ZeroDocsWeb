Zero Engine Showcase
====================

.. rst-class:: SearchDescription

The Zero Engine has the potential to allow you produce some absolutely amazing games. Many impressive experiences have been made by students and faculty at DigiPen. Below are some of the more notable projects from the past several years.

Frozen Masquerade
-----------------

Frozen Masquerade is a 2D Fighter about spirits in a snowy mountain region. The game supports up to 4 players, has 8 playable characters, 6 stages, and AI controlled players. Players engage in round-based combat and battle it out until there is a winner. The game features a unique tug of war health mechanic that allows players to gain back health while attacking their opponents. This allows comebacks to happen at any time since hitting your opponent puts you farther from losing.
