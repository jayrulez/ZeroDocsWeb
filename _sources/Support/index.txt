Zero Engine Support
===================

The Zero Engine is a powerful simulation engine, custom built in C++ by DigiPenâ€™s Research and Development Team (a group of DigiPen graduates and instructors). We strive to make the best engine to not only make games but to learn how to do so. We want our users to want to use our engine and to make awesome games and experiences in it. To that end we offer developer support in addition to the online documentation.
