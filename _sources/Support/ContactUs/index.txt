Contact Us
==========

We provide various avenues for users to contact us for support.

Bug Reporting

Hey you found a bug in the engine. We're sorry, learn how to help us fix it here!

Zero Chat
---------

One of the greatest assets to learning and using the Zero Engine is the community. To encourage collaboration between users we put a community chat in Zero, and guess what, the Zero Engine developers are on the chat too.
